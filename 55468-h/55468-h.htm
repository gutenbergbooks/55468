<small>BOW CREEK</small></h2>
</div>

<p>How musical are the place names on the tidal water of
Dart. Tuckenhay and Greenway, Stoke Gabriel and Dittisham,
Sharpham and Duncannon&mdash;a chime of bells to
the native ear that knows them.</p>

<p>To-day autumn rainbows burnt low on the ferny hills
and set their russet flashing. Then hailstorms churned
the river into a flurry and swept seaward under a grey
cowl. They came with a rush of wind, that brought
scarlet leaves from the wild cherry and gold dust from
the larch; but soon the air cleared and the sun returned,
while the silver fret of the river&rsquo;s face grew calm again
to mirror far-off things. Easterly the red earth arched
low on the blue sky; west spread cobweb-grey orchards,
their leaves fallen, their last of apples still twinkling&mdash;topaz
and ruby&mdash;among the lichens of their ancient
boughs. Then broad, oaken hangers met the beech scrub
and the pale oak foliage was as a flame dancing above
the red-hot fire of the beeches. Their conflagrations
blazed along the tideway and their reflected colour poured
down over the woods into the water.</p>

<p>Then elm trees rolled out along the river, and above
them, in billows mightier than they, sailed the light-laden
clouds, that seemed to lift another forest, bossed and
rounded as the elm trees, and carry up their image into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
the sky. But the cloud glory was pale, its sun touched
summits faint against the ardour of the earthborn elms.</p>

<p>At water&rsquo;s brink, above Stoke Gabriel&rsquo;s little pier and
gleam of white and rose-washed cots, black swine were
rooting for acorns; while westerly an arm of Dart extended
up Bow Creek through such sunlight as made the
eyes throb and turn to the cool shadows. Another silver
loop and Duncannon cuddled in an elbow of the river;
then, higher yet, the hills heaved along Sharpham&rsquo;s hanging
woods turned from the sun. The immense curtain of
trees faced north in tapestry of temperate tones painted
with purple and grey and the twilight colours of autumn
foliage seen through shadows. The ash was already naked&mdash;a
clean skeleton against the dun mass of dying foliage&mdash;and
other trees were casting down their garments; but
the firs and spruce made rich contrast of blue and green
upon the sere.</p>

<p>Beyond Sharpham, long river flats rolled out, where
plover and gulls sat on tussocks of reed, or rush, and curlew
wheeled and mewed overhead. Then opened a point,
where, robbed of colour, all mist-laden, amid gentle passages
of receding banks and trees, there lifted the church
tower of Totnes, with Dartmoor flung in a dim arc beyond.</p>

<p>So Dart came, beside old, fern-clad wharves, through
sedge-beds and reed ronds to the end of her estuary under
the glittering apron of a weir. Then the pulse of the
sea ceased to beat; the tide bade farewell, and the salmon
leapt from salt to fresh.</p>

<p>Worthy of worship in all her times and seasons; by her
subtleties and sleights, her sun and shadow; by her laughter
and coy approaches; by her curves and colours; her
green hills and delight of woods and valleys; by her many
voices; her changing moods and little lovelinesses, Dart
is all Devon and so incomparably England.</p>

<p>A boat moved on Bow Creek, and in it there sat two
men and a young woman. One man rowed while his wife<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
and the other man watched him. He pulled a long, powerful
stroke, and the little vessel slipped up the estuary on a
tide that was at flood, pondering a moment before the turn.
The banks were a blaze of autumn colour, beneath which
shelving planes of stone sank down to the water. The
woman twirled an umbrella to dry it from the recent storm.
She was cold and shivered a little, for though the sun shone
again, the north wind blew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fearing we oughtn&rsquo;t to have come, Medora,&rdquo; said
the man who sat beside her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take my coat,&rdquo; advised Medora&rsquo;s husband. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
dry enough inside.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stopped rowing, took off his coat and handed it to
his wife, who slipped it over her white blouse, but did not
thank him.</p>

<p>Medora Dingle was a dark-faced girl, with black hair
and a pair of deep, brown eyes&mdash;lovely, but restless&mdash;under
clean, arched eye-brows. Her mouth was red and
small, her face fresh and rosy. She seemed self-conscious,
and shivered a little more than was natural; for she was
strong and hearty enough in body, tall and lithe, one
who laboured six days a week and had never known sickness.
Two of her fingers were tied up in cotton rags,
and one of the wounds was on her ring finger so that her
wedding ring was not visible.</p>

<p>Presently Edward Dingle put down the oars.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now you can take it on, old chap,&rdquo; he said, and then
changed places with his companion. The men were very
unlike, but each comely after his fashion. Dingle was
the bigger&mdash;a broad-shouldered, loose-limbed youth of
five-and-twenty, with a head rather small for his bulk,
and a pleasant laughter-loving expression. He was fair
and pretty rather than handsome. His features were
regular, his eyes blue, his hair straw-coloured and curly.
A small moustache did not conceal his good-humoured
mouth. His voice was high-pitched, and he chattered a
great deal of nothing. He was a type of the slight, kindly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
man taken for granted&mdash;a man whose worth is under-valued
by reason of his unimportance to himself. He
had a boundless good nature combined with a modest
mind.</p>

<p>Jordan Kellock stood an inch or two shorter than Dingle
and was a year or two older. He shaved clean, and
brushed his dark, lustreless hair off his high forehead without
parting it. Of a somewhat sallow complexion, with
grey, deliberate eyes and a clean-cut, thin-lipped mouth,
his brow suggested idealism and enthusiasm; there was
a light in his solemn eyes and a touch of the sensitive
about his nose. He spoke slowly, with a level, monotonous
accent, and in this also offered an abrupt contrast to his
companion.</p>

<p>It seemed that he felt the reality of life and was pervious
to impressions. He rowed with less mannerism, and a
slower stroke than his friend; but the boat moved faster
than it had with Dingle at the oars, for Kellock was a
very strong man, and his daily work had developed his
breast and arms abnormally.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A pity now,&rdquo; said Ned, &ldquo;that you didn&rsquo;t let me fetch
your thick coat, Medora, like I wanted to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ought to have fetched it,&rdquo; she answered impatiently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I offered, and you said you didn&rsquo;t want it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s like you. Throw the blame on me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no blame to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ought to have just brought the thing and not
bothered me about it,&rdquo; she declared.</p>

<p>Then her husband laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I ought,&rdquo; he admitted; &ldquo;but it takes a man such
a hell of a time to know just what he ought to do where
a woman&rsquo;s concerned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not where his wife&rsquo;s concerned, I should think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hardest of all, I reckon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, because a wife&rsquo;s truthful most times,&rdquo; replied
Medora. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no good her pretending&mdash;there&rsquo;s nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
to gain by it. Other women often pretend that a man&rsquo;s
pleasing them, when he&rsquo;s not&mdash;just for politeness to the
stupid things; but a man&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;s a fool to waste time like
that. The sooner she trains her husband up to the truth
of her, the better for him and the better for her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They wrangled a little, then Ned laughed again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now Jordan will let on you and me are quarrelling,&rdquo;
he said.</p>

<p>Thus challenged, the rower answered, but he was quite
serious in his reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Last thing I should be likely to do&mdash;even if it was
true. A man and his wife can argue a point without any
feeling, of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So they can,&rdquo; declared Medora. &ldquo;And a proud
woman don&rsquo;t let even a friend see her troubles. Not that
I&rsquo;ve got any troubles, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And never will have, I hope,&rdquo; answered Kellock
gravely.</p>

<p>The creek began to close, and ahead loomed a wharf and
a building standing upon it. The hills grew higher round
about, and the boat needed steering as her channel became
narrower.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tide&rsquo;s turning,&rdquo; said Ned, and for answer, the rower
quickened his stroke.</p>

<p>They passed the wharf, where a trout stream from a
coomb ran into the estuary, then, ascending to the head
of the boatable waters, reached their destination. Already
the tide was falling and revealing weedy rocks and
a high-water mark on either bank of the creek. To the
right a little boathouse opened its dark mouth over the
water, and now they slipped into it and came ashore.</p>

<p>Medora thanked Jordan Kellock warmly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think I didn&rsquo;t enjoy it because I got a bit
chilly after the hailstorm,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I did enjoy it ever
so much, and it was very kind of you to ask me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The last time we&rsquo;ll go boating this year,&rdquo; he answered,
&ldquo;and it was a good day, though cold along of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
north wind. But the autumn woods were very fine,
I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Properly lovely&mdash;poetry alive you might call them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I thought,&rdquo; he answered as he turned down his
sleeves and presently put on his coat and tie again. The
coat was black and the tie a subdued green.</p>

<p>Ned made the boat ship-shape and turned to his wife.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A good smart walk up the hill will warm you,&rdquo; he
said.</p>

<p>She hesitated and whispered to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you ask Jordan to tea?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, certainly,&rdquo; he answered aloud. &ldquo;Medora&rsquo;s
wishful for you to come to tea, old man. So I hope you
will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should have liked to do it,&rdquo; replied Kellock; &ldquo;but
I&rsquo;ve promised to see Mr. Trenchard. It&rsquo;s about the
moulds for the advertisements.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right. He&rsquo;ll want me, too, I reckon over that job.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He will without a doubt. In fact it&rsquo;s more up to you
than me. Everything depends on the pulp.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So it does with all paper,&rdquo; declared Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;True enough. The beaterman&rsquo;s master. For these
fancy pictures for exhibition you&rsquo;ve got to mix stuff as
fine as clear soup&mdash;just the contrary of what you may
call real paper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you coming, Ned?&rdquo; asked Medora. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to
get over to mother to-morrow and I don&rsquo;t want to go with
a cold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Coming, coming,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;So long, Jordan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-bye till Monday,&rdquo; answered the other. Then
he stood still and watched the young couple tramp off together.</p>

<p>He gazed thoughtfully and when they disappeared up
a steep woodland path, he shook his head. They were
gone to Ashprington village, where they dwelt; but Mr.
Kellock lived at Dene where the trout stream descended
from the hills to the river. He crossed from the boat-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>house
by a row of stepping-stones set athwart the creek;
then he turned to the left and soon found himself at the
cottage where he lodged.</p>

<p>This man and Dingle had both loved Medora Trivett,
and for some time she had hesitated between them. But
Ned won her and the loser, taking his defeat in a large
and patient spirit, continued to remain good friends with
both.</p>

<p>Mr. Kellock knew, what everybody guessed, that after
a year of marriage, the pair were not happy together,
though why this should be so none could at present determine.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br />

<small>MAGIC PICTURES</small></h2></div>


<p>Stopping only to wash his hands and brush his hair, Kellock
left his rooms and hastened up the coomb, where
towered immense congeries of buildings under the slope of
the hills. Evening sunshine fell over the western height
which crowned the valley, and still caught the upper windows
of the factory; but the huge shadow quickly climbed
upward as the sun set.</p>

<p>A small house stood at the main gate of Dene Paper
Mill, and at the door sat a man reading a paper and smoking
his pipe.</p>

<p>It was Mr. Trood, foreman of the works.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guvnor&rsquo;s asking for you, Kellock,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Five
o&rsquo;clock was the time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jordan hurried on to the deserted mills, for the day was
Saturday and work had ceased at noon. Threading the
silent shops he presently reached a door on an upper floor,
marked &ldquo;Office,&rdquo; knocked and was told to enter.</p>

<p>On the left of the chamber sat a broad-shouldered man
writing at a roll-top desk; under the windows of the room,
which faced north, extended a long table heaped with paper
of all descriptions and colours.</p>

<p>The master twisted round on his office chair, then rose
and lighted a cigarette. He was clean-shaved with iron-grey
hair and a searching but genial expression. His
face shone with intelligence and humour. It was strong
and accurately declared the man, for indomitable perseverance
and courage belonged to Matthew Trenchard.</p>

<p>His own success he attributed to love of sport and love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
of fun. These pursuits made him sympathetic and understanding.
He recognised his responsibilities and his rule
of conduct in his relations with the hundred men and
women he employed was to keep in closest possible touch
with them. He held it good for them and vital for himself
that he should know what was passing in their minds;
for only thus could he discover the beginning of grievances
and destroy them in the egg. He believed that the longer
a trouble grew, the more difficult it was to dissipate, and
by establishing intimate relations with his staff and impressing
upon them his own situation, his successes and
his failures, he succeeded in fixing unusual bonds.</p>

<p>For the most part his people felt that Trenchard&rsquo;s good
was their own&mdash;not because he said so, but because he
made it so; and save for certain inevitable spirits, who
objected on principle to all existing conditions between
capital and labour, the workers trusted him and spoke
well of him.</p>

<p>Kellock was first vatman at Dene, and one of the best
paper makers in England. Both knew their worth and
each was satisfied with the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard from that South American Republic, Kellock,&rdquo;
said Mr. Trenchard. &ldquo;They like the new currency
paper and the colour suits them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very fine paper, Mr. Trenchard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just the exact opposite of what I&rsquo;m after for these
advertisements. The public, Kellock, must be appealed
to by the methods of Cheap Jack at the fair. They love
a conjuring trick, and if you can stop them long enough
to ask &lsquo;how&rsquo;s it done?&rsquo; you often interest them and win
them. Now samples of our great papers mean nothing
to anybody but the dealers. The public doesn&rsquo;t know
hand-made paper from machine-made. What we&rsquo;ve got
to do is to show them&mdash;not tip-top paper, but a bit of
magic; and such a fool is the public that when he sees
these pictures in water-mark, he&rsquo;ll think the paper that
produces them must be out of the common good. We know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
that it&rsquo;s not &lsquo;paper&rsquo; at all in our sense, and that it&rsquo;s
a special brew for this special purpose; but the public,
amazed by the pictures, buys our paper and doesn&rsquo;t know
that the better the paper, the more impossible such sleight
of hand would be upon it. We show them one thing which
awakes their highest admiration and causes them to buy
another!&rdquo;</p>

<p>All this Jordan Kellock very well understood, and his
master knew that he did; but Trenchard liked to talk and
excelled in lucid exposition.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said the vatman; &ldquo;they think that the
paper that can take such pictures must be good for anything;
though the truth is that it&rsquo;s good for nothing&mdash;but
the pictures. If there was any quality to the pulp,
it could never run into such moulds as these were made in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He began to pick up the impressions of a series of large,
exhibition water-marks, and hold them to the windows,
that their transparent wonders might be seen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Real works of art,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;with high lights and deep
shadows and rare half tones and colour, too, all on stuff
like tissue. The beaterman must give me pulp as fine as
flour to get such impressions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Finer than flour, my lad. The new moulds are even
more wonderful. It is no good doing what your father
did over again. My father beat my grandfather; so it&rsquo;s
my duty to beat him&mdash;see?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;These are wonderful enough in all conscience.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And for the Exhibition I mean to turn out something
more wonderful still. Something more than craft&mdash;real
art, my friend. I want the artists. I want them to see
what our art paper for water-colour work is. They don&rsquo;t
know yet&mdash;at least only a handful of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But this is different. The pulp to do this sort of
thing must be as thin as water,&rdquo; said Kellock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fibre is the first consideration for paper that&rsquo;s going
to be as everlasting as parchment; but these water-mark
masterpieces are <i>tours de force</i>&mdash;conjuring tricks as I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
call them. And I want to give the public a conjuring
trick more wonderful than they&rsquo;ve ever seen in paper before;
and I&rsquo;m going to do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No paper maker ever beat these, Mr. Trenchard,&rdquo; declared
Kellock. He held up large sheets of the size known
as &ldquo;elephant.&rdquo; They appeared to be white until illuminated;
then they revealed shades of delicate duck-green,
sunrise yellow, dark blue, light blue and umber.</p>

<p>A portrait by Romney of Lady Hamilton shone through
the first, and the solidity of the dark masses, the rendering
of the fabric and the luminous quality of the flesh were
wonderfully translated by the daylight filtering through.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There can be no painted pictures like these,&rdquo; said
Matthew Trenchard stoutly. &ldquo;And why? Because the
painter uses paint; I use pure daylight, and the sweetest
paint that ever was isn&rsquo;t a patch on the light of day.
Such things as these are more beautiful than pictures,
just because the living light from the sky is more beautiful
than any pigment made by man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kellock was too cautious to agree with these revolutionary
theories.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly these things would be very fine to decorate
our windows, if we didn&rsquo;t want to look out of them,&rdquo; he
admitted.</p>

<p>Then he held up a portrait of Her Majesty, Queen Victoria.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pure ultramarine blue, you see,&rdquo; commented the master,
&ldquo;and the light brings out its richness, though if you
looked at the paper, you&rsquo;d be puzzled to find any blue in it.
That&rsquo;s because the infinitely fine atoms of the colour would
want a microscope to see their separate particles. Yet
where the pulp sank to the depths of the mould, they collected
in millions to give you those deep shadows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kellock delayed at the copy of a statue: the Venus
Victrix from Naples&mdash;a work which certainly reproduced
the majesty of the original in a rounded, lustrous fashion
that no reproduction on the flat could echo.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t beat that, though it is fifty years old,&rdquo; declared
Kellock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to, however; and another statue is my
idea. Marble comes out grandly as you see. I&rsquo;m out for
black and white, not colour. I&rsquo;ve an idea we can get something
as fine as the old masters of engraving, and finer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The vatman is nought for this work,&rdquo; confessed Kellock.
&ldquo;He makes paper in his mould and that&rsquo;s all there
is to it&mdash;whether for printing, or writing, or painting.
The man who matters is him who makes the mould.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we can help him; we can experiment at the vat and
in the beating engine. We can go one better in the pulp;
and the stroke counts at the vat. I reckon your stroke
will be invaluable to work the pulp into every cranny of
such moulds as I&rsquo;m thinking about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my best; so will Dingle; but how many men in
England are there who could make such moulds as these to-day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three,&rdquo; replied Trenchard. &ldquo;But I want better
moulds. I&rsquo;m hopeful that Michael Thorn of London will
rise to it. I go to see him next week, and we put in a
morning at the British Museum to find a statue worthy
of the occasion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can see a wonderful thing in my mind&rsquo;s eye already,&rdquo;
declared Kellock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you? Well, I never can see anything in my
mind&rsquo;s eye and rest content for an hour, till I set about the
way to see it with my body&rsquo;s eye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We all know that, Mr. Trenchard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s my favourite,&rdquo; declared the other, holding up
a massive head of Abraham Lincoln. &ldquo;Now that&rsquo;s a
great work in my judgment and if we beat that in quality,
we shall produce a water-mark picture worth talking
about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ought to show all these too,&rdquo; said Jordan Kellock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall&mdash;if I beat them; not if they beat me,&rdquo; replied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
the other. &ldquo;I wanted you to see what my father and
grandfather could do, so that you may judge what we&rsquo;re
up against. But they&rsquo;re going to be beaten at Dene, or
else I&rsquo;ll know the reason why.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good to see such things and worth while trying
to beat them,&rdquo; answered the vatman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To improve upon the past is the business of every
honest man in my opinion,&rdquo; declared Trenchard.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re here for; and that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve done,
I believe, thanks to a lot of clever people here who have
helped me to do it and share what credit there may be.
But I don&rsquo;t claim credit, Ned. It&rsquo;s common duty for
every man with brains in his head to help push the craft
along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And keep its head above water,&rdquo; added the listener.</p>

<p>Matthew Trenchard eyed him doubtfully and lighted
another cigarette.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he admitted rather reluctantly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
right. Hand-made paper&rsquo;s battling for its life in one
sense&mdash;like a good many other hand-made things. But
the machine hasn&rsquo;t caught us yet and it will be a devil
of a long time before it does, I hope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s for us not to let it,&rdquo; said Jordan&mdash;a sentiment
the paper master approved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fair,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m not going to pretend
the machine isn&rsquo;t turning out some properly wonderful
papers; and I&rsquo;m not going to say it isn&rsquo;t doing far better
things than ever I thought it would do. I don&rsquo;t laugh
at it as my grandfather did, or shake my head at it as
my father used. I recognise our craft is going down
hill. But we ain&rsquo;t at the bottom by a long way; and
when we get there, we&rsquo;ll go game and die like gentlemen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They talked awhile longer; then the dusk came down,
Kellock departed and Trenchard, turning on an electric
light, resumed his writing.</p>

<small>PRIORY FARM</small></h2></div>


<p>From Dene a mighty hill climbs southward to Cornworthy
village. &ldquo;The Corkscrew&rdquo; it is called, and men merciful
to their beasts choose a longer and more gradual ascent.
But not a few of the workers engaged at the paper mill
tramped this zig-zag steep six days out of every seven,
and among these Lydia Trivett, the mother of Medora,
could boast twenty years of regular perambulation. Only
on rare occasions, when &ldquo;Corkscrew&rdquo; was coated with
ice, did she take the long detour by the little lake above
the works.</p>

<p>She had lived at Ashprington until her husband died;
then she and her daughter came to live with her brother,
Thomas Dolbear, of Priory Farm. He was a bachelor
then; but at forty he wedded; and now Medora had her
own home, while her mother still dwelt with Mr. Dolbear,
his wife, Mary, and their increasing family.</p>

<p>Lydia was a little brisk woman of fifty&mdash;the mistress
of the rag house at the mills. She was still comely and
trim, for hard work agreed with her. A very feminine air
marked her, and Medora had won her good looks from her
mother, though not her affectation, for Mrs. Trivett was
a straightforward and unassuming soul. She had much
to pride herself upon, but never claimed credit in any
direction.</p>

<p>Priory Farm stood under a great slope of orchard and
meadow, upon the crown of which the priory ruins ascended.
The farm was at the bottom of a hill, and immediately
opposite climbed the solitary street of Cornworthy
village capped by the church. The church and the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
Cistercean ruin looked across the dip in the land at each
other.</p>

<p>Now, on Sunday afternoon, Lydia, at the garden gate
of her brother&rsquo;s house, started off six children to Sunday
school. Five were girls and one was a boy. They ranged
from twelve years old to three; while at home a two year
old baby&mdash;another girl&mdash;remained with her mother.
Mary Dolbear expected her tenth child during the coming
spring. Two had died in infancy. She was an inert,
genial mass of a woman, who lived only for her children
and the business of maternity. Her husband worshipped
her and they increased and multiplied proudly. Their
house, but for Lydia&rsquo;s sleepless ministrations, would have
been a pigstye. They were indifferent to dirt and chose
to make all things subservient to the demands of their children.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The cradle rules the world, so enough said,&rdquo; was Tom
Dolbear&rsquo;s argument when people protested at the chaos
in which he lived. He was a stout man with a fat, boyish
face, scanty, sandy hair and a narrow forehead, always
wrinkled by reason of the weakness of his eyes. He had
a smile like a baby and was indeed a very childish man;
but he knew his business and made his farm suffice for
his family needs.</p>

<p>In this house Lydia&rsquo;s own room was an oasis in a wilderness.
There one found calm, order, cleanliness, distinction.
She trusted nobody in it but herself and always
locked the door when she left for work.</p>

<p>It was regarded as a sacred room, for both Mary and
her husband reverenced Lydia and blessed the Providence
that had sent her to them. They treated her with the
greatest respect, always gave way to her and recognised
very acutely the vital force she represented in the inert
and sprawling domesticity of their establishment. Once,
when an idea was whispered that Tom&rsquo;s sister might leave
him, Mary fell absolutely ill and refused to eat and drink
until she changed her mind and promised to stay.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>To do them justice they never took Lydia for granted.
Their gratitude flowed in a steady stream. They gave her
all credit and all admiration, and went their philoprogenitive
way with light hearts.</p>

<p>Now Mrs. Trivett watched her nieces and nephew march
together in their Sunday best along the way to Sunday
school. Then she was about to shut the wicket and return
up the garden path, when a man appeared on the high
road and a fellow worker at the Mill accosted her.</p>

<p>Nicholas Pinhey was a finisher; that is to say the paper
passed through his hands last before it left the works.
With the multifarious processes of its creation he had
nothing to do; but every finished sheet and stack of sheets
touched his fingers before it entered the world, and he was
well skilled in the exacting duties of his own department.</p>

<p>He was a thin, prim bachelor of sixty&mdash;a man of nice
habits and finicking mind. There was much of the old
maid in him, too, and he gossiped inordinately, but never
unkindly. He knew the life history, family interests and
private ambitions of everybody in the Mill. He smelt
mystery where none existed and much feared the modern
movements and threats of labour. Especially was he
doubtful of Jordan Kellock and regarded him as a dangerous
and too progressive spirit.</p>

<p>His interest in other people&rsquo;s affairs now appeared; for
he had come to see Lydia; he had climbed &ldquo;The Corkscrew&rdquo;
on Sunday from most altruistic motives.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The better the day the better the deed,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve walked over for a cup of tea and a talk, because a
little bird&rsquo;s told me something I don&rsquo;t much like, Mrs.
Trivett, and it concerns you in a manner of speaking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You always keep to the point, Mr. Pinhey; and I dare
say I know what the point is for that matter. Come in.
We can talk very well, because we shall be alone in a
minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nicholas followed her into the parlour, a room of good
size on the left hand side of the entrance. They surprised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
Mrs. Dolbear nodding beside the fire. She liked Mr. Pinhey,
but she was glad of the excuse to leave them and
retire to her own room.</p>

<p>She shook hands with the visitor, who hoped she found
herself as well as could be expected.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I take these things from whence
they come. I feel no fear except in one particular.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got the
courage to fight lions and the faith to move mountains.
We all know that. If the women in general would come
to the business of the next generation with your fearless
nature, we might hear less about the decrease of the population.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not my part I trouble about; it&rsquo;s the Lord&rsquo;s,&rdquo;
explained Mrs. Dolbear. &ldquo;If I have another girl, it&rsquo;ll
break Tom&rsquo;s heart. Six maids and one boy is the record
so far, though of the two we&rsquo;ve buried, one was a boy.
And such is my perfect trust in myself, if I could choose
what I want from the Almighty at this moment, it would
be two men children.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Magnificent!&rdquo; said Mr. Pinhey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I take Lydia to witness I speak no more than the
truth,&rdquo; replied the matron. &ldquo;But these things are out of
our keeping, though Tom read in a paper some time since
a remarkable verdict, that if a woman with child ate
enough green stuff, she might count on a boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a painful subject,&rdquo; said Lydia, &ldquo;and you&rsquo;d
better not talk about it, Polly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was painful at the time,&rdquo; admitted Mrs. Dolbear,
&ldquo;because Tom&rsquo;s one of they hopeful men, who will always
jump at a new thing like a trout jumps at a fly. And
what was the result? From the moment he hit on that
cussed paper, he fed me more like a cow than a creature
with a soul. &rsquo;Twas green stuff morning, noon and night&mdash;lettuce
and spinach&mdash;which I hate any time&mdash;and
broccoli and turnip tops and spring onions and cauliflower
and Lord knows what mess till I rebelled and defied the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
man. I didn&rsquo;t lose my temper; but I said, calm and slow,
&lsquo;Tom,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;if you don&rsquo;t want me to be brought to a
bed of cabbage next September, stop it. God&rsquo;s my judge,&rsquo;
I said, &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t let down another herb of the field. I
want red meat,&rsquo; I told him, &lsquo;or else I won&rsquo;t be responsible.&rsquo;
He argued for it, but I had my way and Lydia
upheld me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what was the result in the family line if I may
venture to ask?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Pinhey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The result in the family line was Jane Ethel,&rdquo; answered
Mrs. Dolbear; &ldquo;and where is Jane Ethel now,
Lydia?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In her little grave,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Trivett.</p>

<p>Her sister-in-law immediately began to weep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you cry, my dear, it wasn&rsquo;t your fault. The
poor baby was born with death in her eyes, as I always
said.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Dolbear sighed and moved ponderously across the
room. She was short and broad with a touzled head of
golden hair and a colourless face. But her smile was
beautiful and her teeth perfect.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dare say you&rsquo;ll want to talk before tea,&rdquo; she suggested;
&ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll go and have a bit of a sleep. I always
say, &lsquo;where there&rsquo;s sleep, there&rsquo;s hope.&rsquo; And I want more
than most people, and I can take it any time in the twenty-four
hours of the clock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She waddled away and Mrs. Trivett explained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Polly&rsquo;s a proper wonder for sleep. It&rsquo;s grown into a
habit. She&rsquo;ll call out for a nap at the most unseasonable
moments. She&rsquo;ll curl up anywhere and go off. We shan&rsquo;t
see her again till supper I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder. Sit you down
and tell me what you come for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The work you must do in this house!&rdquo; said Mr. Pinhey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like work and this is my home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A home I suppose, but not what I should call an abiding
place,&rdquo; hazarded the man.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want no abiding place, because we know, if
we&rsquo;re Christians, that there&rsquo;s no abiding place this side
of the grave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You take it in your usual high spirit. And now&mdash;you&rsquo;ll
forgive me if I&rsquo;m personal, Mrs. Trivett. You
know the man that speaks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You want to better something I&rsquo;m sure, else you
wouldn&rsquo;t be here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is just as you say: I want to better something.
We bachelors look out on life from our lonely towers, so
to say, and we get a bird&rsquo;s eye view of the people; and
if we see a thing not all it might be, &rsquo;tis our duty in my
opinion to try and set it right. And to be quite frank
and in all friendship, I&rsquo;m very much afraid your Medora
and her husband ain&rsquo;t heart and soul together as they
should be. If I&rsquo;m wrong, then thank God and enough
said. But am I wrong?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Trivett considered some moments before answering.
Then she replied:</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Nicholas Pinhey, you&rsquo;re not wrong, and I wish I
could say you were. You have seen what&rsquo;s true; but I
wouldn&rsquo;t say the mischief was deep yet. It may be in our
power to nip it in the bud.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You grant it&rsquo;s true, and that excuses me for touching
it. I know my manners I hope, and to anybody else
I wouldn&rsquo;t have come; but you&rsquo;re different, and if I can
prevail upon you to handle Medora, I shall feel I have
done all I can do, or have a right to do. In these delicate
cases, the thing is to know where the fault lies. And
most times it&rsquo;s with the man, no doubt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that. It isn&rsquo;t this time anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Pinhey was astonished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you mean to say you see your own daughter
unfavourable?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must know the right of a thing if you want to do
any good,&rdquo; declared Lydia. &ldquo;Half the failure to right
wrong so far as I can see, is owing to a muddled view of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
what the wrong is. I&rsquo;ve hung back about this till I could
see it clear, and I won&rsquo;t say I do see it clear yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I speak as a bachelor,&rdquo; repeated Mr. Pinhey, &ldquo;and
therefore with reserve and caution. And if you&mdash;the
mother of one of the parties&mdash;don&rsquo;t feel you can safely
take a hand, it certainly isn&rsquo;t for anybody else to try.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As a matter of fact, I was going to do something this
very day. My daughter&rsquo;s coming to tea and I mean to
ask her what the matter is. She&rsquo;s not prone to be exactly
straight, is Medora, but seeing I want nothing but
her good, I hope she&rsquo;ll be frank with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man felt mildly surprised to hear a mother criticise
her daughter so frankly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought a child could do no wrong in its parents&rsquo;
eyes,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Depends on the parent, Mr. Pinhey. If you want to
help your child, &rsquo;tis no use beginning by taking that line.
If we can do wrong, as God knows we can, so can our
children, and it&rsquo;s a vain sort of love to suppose they&rsquo;re
perfect. Medora&rsquo;s got a great many good qualities, but,
like other pretty girls, she&rsquo;s handicapped here and there.
A right down pretty girl don&rsquo;t know she&rsquo;s born most times,
because everybody in trousers bows down before her and
helps to shut reality out of her life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the same with money,&rdquo; surmised Nicholas. &ldquo;Let
a young person have money and they look at the world
through tinted glasses. The truth&rsquo;s hidden from them,
and some such go to their graves and never know truth,
while others, owing to chance, lose the stuff that stands
between them and reality and have a very painful wakening.
But as to beauty&mdash;you was a woman to the full
as fair as your girl&mdash;yet look how you weathered the
storm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Lydia, &ldquo;I never had Medora&rsquo;s looks.
In her case life&rsquo;s been too smooth and easy if anything.
She had a comfortable home with Tom here after her
father died; and then came along a choice of two good men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
to wed her and the admiration of a dozen others. She was
in two minds between Kellock and Dingle for a while; but
her luck held and she took the right one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure of that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;for Medora. That&rsquo;s not to say that Jordan
Kellock isn&rsquo;t a cleverer chap than my son-in-law. Of
course he is. He&rsquo;s got more mind and more sight. He
has ideas about labour and a great gift of determination;
and he&rsquo;s ambitious. He&rsquo;ll go a long way further than
Ned. But against that you can set Ned&rsquo;s unshakable
good temper and light heart. It&rsquo;s grander for a man
to have a heavy heart than a light, when he looks out at
the world; but they heavy-hearted, earnest men, who want
to help to set life right, call for a different fashion of wife
from Medora. If such men wed, they should seek women
in their own pattern&mdash;the earnest&mdash;deadly earnest sort&mdash;who
don&rsquo;t think of themselves, or their clothes, or their
looks, or their comforts. They should find their helpmates
in a kind of female that&rsquo;s rare still, though they
grow commoner. And Medora ain&rsquo;t that sort, and if
she&rsquo;d took Kellock she&rsquo;d have been no great use to him
and he&rsquo;d have been no lasting use to her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; murmured Mr. Pinhey, &ldquo;how you look into
things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ned&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Trivett. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s all
right, for Medora; and she ought to be all right for him.
He loves her with all his heart and, in a word, she doesn&rsquo;t
know her luck. That&rsquo;s what I must try and show her if
I can. It&rsquo;s just a sort of general discontent about nothing
in particular. You can&rsquo;t have it both ways. Ned&rsquo;s
easy and likes a bit of fun. He&rsquo;s a good workman&mdash;in
fact above the average, or he wouldn&rsquo;t be where he is.
As a beaterman you won&rsquo;t find his better in any paper
mill; but it ends there. He does his work and he&rsquo;s reached
his limit. And away from work, he&rsquo;s just a schoolboy
from his task. He&rsquo;s light hearted and ought to be happy;
and if she is not, he&rsquo;ll worry a great deal. But he won&rsquo;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
know what&rsquo;s the matter, any more than Medora herself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Pinhey&rsquo;s conventional mind proceeded in its natural
groove.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To say it delicately, perhaps if a child was to come
along it would smooth out the crumpled rose-leaves,&rdquo; he
suggested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You might think so; but it isn&rsquo;t that. They both
agree there. They don&rsquo;t like children and don&rsquo;t want
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I should be the last to blame them, I&rsquo;m sure.
It may not be true to nature, but it&rsquo;s true to truth, that
the young married couples ain&rsquo;t so keen about families
as they used to be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nature&rsquo;s at odds with a good deal we do,&rdquo; answered
Lydia. &ldquo;Time was when a quiver full of young ones
seemed good to the people. But education has changed all
that. There&rsquo;s selfishness in shirking a family no doubt;
but there&rsquo;s also sense. And the better the education
grows, the shorter the families will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They talked on until Medora herself arrived and the
children came back from Sunday school. Then Mrs.
Trivett and a maid prepared the tea and Mr. Pinhey,
against his inclination, shared the meal. He noticed that
Medora was kind to the little ones, but not enthusiastic
about them. His own instincts made him shrink before
so much happy and hungry youth feeding heartily. The
children scattered crumbs and seemed to create an atmosphere
of jam and a general stickiness around them.
They also made a great deal of noise.</p>

<p>Their mother did not appear and when Nicholas asked
for their father, the eldest daughter told him that Mr. Dolbear
was gone out for the day with his dogs and a ferret.</p>

<p>He whispered under his breath, &ldquo;Ferreting on the Sabbath!&rdquo;</p>

<p>After tea he took leave and returned home. Then Medora
and her mother went into the orchard with the chil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>dren,
and Mrs. Trivett, wasting no words, asked her
daughter what was vexing her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say as much or as little as you please, my dear&mdash;nothing
if I can&rsquo;t help you. But perhaps I can. It looks
as though everybody but Ned sees there&rsquo;s something on
your mind. Can&rsquo;t you tell me what it is&mdash;or better still,
tell him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Medora flushed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing the matter that can be helped,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;Ned can&rsquo;t help being himself, I suppose, and if
anybody&rsquo;s talking, they ought to be ashamed. It&rsquo;s a
cowardly, mean thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not cowardly, or mean to want to put a wrong
right and make people better content. But nobody wants
to interfere between husband and wife, and the people are
very fond of you both as you well know. You say &lsquo;Ned
can&rsquo;t help being himself.&rsquo; Begin there, then. You&rsquo;ve
been married a year now and you didn&rsquo;t marry in haste
either. He was what he is before you took him. He
hasn&rsquo;t changed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think he was such a fool, if you must know,&rdquo;
said Medora.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;you mean by a fool?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Simple&mdash;like a dog. There&rsquo;s nothing to Ned.
Other men have character and secrets and a bit up their
sleeve. They count, and people know they ain&rsquo;t seeing
the inside of them. Ned&rsquo;s got no inside. He&rsquo;s a boy. I
thought I&rsquo;d married a man and I&rsquo;ve married a great boy.
I&rsquo;m only telling you this, mind. I&rsquo;m a good wife enough;
but I&rsquo;m not a brainless one and I can&rsquo;t help comparing my
husband to other men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You always compare everything you&rsquo;ve got to what
others have got,&rdquo; answered Lydia. &ldquo;When you was a
tiny child, you&rsquo;d love your toys till you saw the toys of
other children. Then you&rsquo;d grow discontent. At school,
if you took a prize, it was poisoned, because some other
girl had got a prettier book than you; and everybody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
else&rsquo;s garden was nicer than ours; and everybody else had
better furniture in their houses and better pictures on
their walls and better clothes on their backs. And now
it&rsquo;s your husband that isn&rsquo;t in it with other people&rsquo;s husbands.
Perhaps you&rsquo;ll tell me, Medora, what husbands
round about can beat Ned for sense and cheerfulness and
an easy mind and the other things that go to make a
home comfortable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everybody isn&rsquo;t married,&rdquo; answered Medora. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t look round and compare Ned to other husbands.
I&rsquo;ve got something better to do. But I can&rsquo;t help seeing
with all his good nature and the rest of it that he&rsquo;s a slight
man&mdash;not a sort for woman to repose upon as something
with quicker wits&mdash;stronger, more masterful than herself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like who?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Trivett.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;I&rsquo;m only speaking to you, mother&mdash;take
yesterday. Jordan Kellock asked us to go for a row in
the gamekeeper&rsquo;s boat and see the river&mdash;me and Ned.
And we went; and how could I help seeing that Jordan had
the brains? Nothing he said, for he&rsquo;s a good friend and
above smallness; but while Ned chattered and laughed and
made a noise, there was Jordan, pleasant and all that;
but you felt behind was strength of character and a mind
working and thinking more than it said; while my husband
was saying more than he thinks. And I hate to hear him
chatter and then, when he&rsquo;s challenged, climb down and
say he sees he was wrong.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to take the rough with the smooth in human
nature, Medora. And it&rsquo;s a bit staggering to hear
you mention Kellock, of all men, seeing the circumstances.
If you feel like that, why didn&rsquo;t you take Kellock when
you could?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Medora&rsquo;s reply caused her mother consternation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;God knows why I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>The elder gave a little gasp and did not answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s wrong when you have to correct your husband<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
in front of another man,&rdquo; continued Medora; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve
got my self respect I believe&mdash;so far&mdash;and I won&rsquo;t let
Ned say foolish things before people and let others think
I&rsquo;m agreeing with him. And if I&rsquo;ve spoken sharp when
men or women at the works heard me, Ned&rsquo;s got himself
to thank for it. Anyway Jordan knows I&rsquo;m not without
brains, and I&rsquo;m not going to pretend I am. I laughed at
Ned in the boat yesterday, and he said after that he didn&rsquo;t
mind my laughing at him, but he wouldn&rsquo;t have it before
people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Trivett left the main issue as a subject too big for
the moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ought not to laugh at him before Mr. Kellock,&rdquo;
she said; &ldquo;because he&rsquo;s one of them serious-minded men
who don&rsquo;t understand laughter. I&rsquo;ve seen a man say
things in a light mood that had no sting in them really,
yet one of the humourless sort, listening, didn&rsquo;t see it was
said for fun, and reported it after and made trouble.
Kellock&rsquo;s a solemn man and would misread it if you scored
off Ned, or said some flashy thing that meant nought in
truth. You know what I mean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They had strolled to the top of the orchard now, where
the children were playing in the Priory ruin. And here
at dusk they parted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll leave it till we can have another talk,&rdquo; said
Lydia; &ldquo;seemingly there&rsquo;s more to talk about than I
thought. Be patient as well as proud, Medora. And
don&rsquo;t feel so troubled about Ned that you haven&rsquo;t got no
spare time to look into your own heart and see if you&rsquo;re
satisfied with yourself. Because very often in my experience,
when we&rsquo;re seeing misfortune and blaming other
people, if we look at home, we&rsquo;ll find the source of the
trouble lies with ourselves and not them.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br />

<small>A NEW VATMAN</small></h2></div>


<p>A man stood on the crown of a limestone quarry, where it
bit into the slope of a green hill. Perched here, three
hundred feet above the valley bottom, a varied scene spread
round about, but he was only concerned with the other
side of the coomb and the great pile of Dene Paper Mill
that stood over against him.</p>

<p>On his left opened the creek heavily fringed with trees.
Mud banks oozed out upon it and the river channel twinkled
in the midst of them. The beholder saw that the sea
ascended to this rural scene, bringing its weeds and shells
to the little beaches and its birds to the air. From this
inlet, the great valley broke and pointed west. It expanded
and widened among such rolling green steeps as
that upon which the stranger stood, and the heights were
capped at the skyline, here by clumps of Scotch fir; here,
by spinneys of oak and elm; here, by arable or pasture.
Rows of small houses lay among the orchards in the bottom,
where a stream wound, and the methodical ordering
of those tenements marked a sharp contrast with the irregular
and older cottages round them. They were the
homes of busy people drawn hither for one purpose, and
above them towered the great hive wherein they worked.
The Mill spread under a knoll of trees on the hillside and
shone out grey and blue against the autumn colour of
the hanging woods behind it.</p>

<p>Wide roofs glittered with glass and the northern face
rose finely with tier on tier of windows outlined in red
brick. Lesser buildings supported the mass to right and
left and a clock-tower and weather-vane surmounted the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
whole. The architectural form, piled without design
through the accretion of years, had yet taken a dignified
and significant completeness. It was stern and plain, but
not ugly and meaningless. Its shape, with outstretched
wings and uplifted turret, like a head, suggested a sentient
organism that could well fight for itself and protect its
interests. It seemed not aggressive, but watchful; no
tyrant to destroy, but a potent, receptive and benevolent
over-lord of the green valley, which it had indeed modified
and awakened, but not robbed of its distinction and
beauty.</p>

<p>The building must have been imposing on a plain, but
the hills rolling round about tended to dwarf its size by
their immense contours. Under some lights indeed the
Mill bulked greater than the surrounding scene and to the
meditative mind far transcended the inert matter heaved
and heaped around it; but to-day Nature was clad in glory
and no building built with hands could compete against her
splendour of blue sky, emerald green grass lands and autumn
groves of beech and oak. Seen in this brilliant setting
Dene Mill was an impression of restrained grey and
silver. Broad lights and shadows brooded over it and
sunshine found the roofs but not the face of the buildings.
Yet no sobriety marked the mass. It never brooded or
sulked, unless the sky lowered and dropped darkness upon
it. There was joy in the feathers of steam that leapt,
and laughter in the broad golden weather-vane above the
clock-tower. Labour pursued in this rural valley seemed
to offer some hope of lessened asperity. Eyes weary with
work might lift to the windows and mirror green and gracious
things&mdash;meadows climbing and orchards and
thatched roofs; or shorn stubbles spreading like cloth
of gold upon the shoulders of the eastern hills.</p>

<p>The beholder marked the people moving about the many
mouths of the great hive beneath him, and being a man apt
to link impressions, he guessed that the Mill had been built
of the stone from the quarry that gaped at his feet. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
rift in the hill extended to a road at the valley bottom,
then sprang trees to fill the space between, so that the
works beyond seemed bowered in foliage on all sides and
framed in thinning boughs.</p>

<p>A bell rang and the people streamed away&mdash;men and
women&mdash;in a little thin trickle, like beads irregularly
scattered on a thread. Here and there the line was brightened
by a flash of colour from a bright sun bonnet, or
gown. The watcher descended now, gained the road below,
then climbed the other side to the Mill.</p>

<p>He was a middle-aged, good-looking man, with a round
face, hair turning grey, and black, rather shifty eyes.
Humour homed on his countenance and merriment and
cunning shared his expression. He carried a large, brown
paper bundle and wore a new, homespun suit, a paper collar,
a sky-blue tie and a cloth cap.</p>

<p>As he passed Mr. Trood&rsquo;s house at the entrance of the
works and proceeded towards them, looking round about
him, there emerged the master, and the new-comer guessed
that he was so.</p>

<p>He touched his hat therefore and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be the boss, I reckon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right&mdash;and what do you want?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Work, Mr. Matthew Trenchard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was not strange to see a wandering paper maker.
The body of these men is small; they know their own
value and, being always precious, can count upon making
a change with safety. They are sought and a first rate
workman need be in no fear of not winning a welcome
where hand paper continues to be manufactured.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What department?&rdquo; asked Trenchard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A vatman, if so be you&rsquo;re wanting a good one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m always wanting a good vatman. We&rsquo;ve got three
of the best in England here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take me and you&rsquo;ll have four,&rdquo; said the man.</p>

<p>Trenchard laughed and looked at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why are you changing?&rdquo; he asked.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>&ldquo;Tired of a town. I come from the midlands; but I
want to be in the country, and knowing about Dene Works,
I thought I&rsquo;d come down and offer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were standing opposite Mr. Trood&rsquo;s house at the
main gate and the master turned and knocked at the door.
Trood himself appeared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A vatman,&rdquo; said Trenchard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By name, Philander Knox,&rdquo; explained the stranger.
&ldquo;I must tell you,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;that I&rsquo;ve got rather a queer
stroke at the vat. People laugh to see me with a mould;
but they don&rsquo;t laugh when they see the paper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shan&rsquo;t quarrel with your stroke if we don&rsquo;t with
your sheet,&rdquo; said Trood. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m for a nice, easy stroke
myself, because it goes farther and faster; but we all
know no two men have the same stroke. We&rsquo;ve got a man
now with a stroke like a cow with a musket; but his paper&rsquo;s
all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can come for a week on trial,&rdquo; declared Trenchard.
&ldquo;Begin to-morrow if you&rsquo;re agreeable to terms.
We&rsquo;re very busy. This is Mr. Trood, our foreman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went homewards and left the others together, while
Mr. Knox produced his credentials.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br />

<small>THE RAG HOUSE</small></h2></div>


<p>The place where Lydia Trivett worked and controlled the
activities of twenty other women was a lofty, raftered hall
lighted from the north by a row of windows under which
the sorters sat. In the midst of the chamber the material
was piled in huge, square bales covered with sacking.
The parcels came from all parts of Europe, where linen
and cotton rag could be obtained; and before they were
handled, the contents entered a thresher for preliminary
dusting. The thresher throbbed and thundered within a
compartment boarded off from the workshop. Here in
a great wooden case, a roller with iron-shod teeth revolved,
while above this lower, moving wheel, fixed prongs stood
similarly armed, so that their teeth passed between each
other at every turn. Here spun the rags and whirled and
tossed, while the dust of France, Belgium, England, Ireland,
Scotland was sucked away from them. Every rag
that entered Dene Mill was subjected to this rough initial
embrace, where Alice Barefoot, a tall, strong woman,
attended the thresher. She was herself of the colour of
dust, with a high complexion and lion-coloured hair, tied
up in a yellow kerchief. She prided herself on doing man&rsquo;s
work and, indeed, accomplished her heavy labours very
completely. The dusted rag she piled in tall baskets,
stopped the thresher, then opened the door of the chamber
and bore the rag out to the sorters. They sat each before
her lattice with the material heaped at her left. The
practised workers dealt very swiftly with the stuff, running
it between their hands and knowing its composition
by touch. Wool or silk sometimes intruded, but was flung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
aside, for only cotton passed to the empty baskets at each
woman&rsquo;s right. The workers were clad in white overalls
and their heads were covered with white caps and bonnets.
Wonderful cleanliness marked them and the atmosphere of
the brightly lighted shop was clear despite the flocculent
material that passed through it.</p>

<p>For purity of air and water, chemicals and working
hands is a vital matter to the paper maker. Every operation
must needs be as cleanly as sleepless precaution can
make it.</p>

<p>From the mountain of rags on her left the sorter plucked
material and picked it over the lattice, an open wire-work
sieve spread before her. Standing beside it was a short
upright knife used to cut the rags and sever from them
the buttons, hooks and eyes, whalebones and other extraneous
additions that had belonged to their earlier incarnations.
These knives were made from old steel scythes
worn too thin for husbandry, but here answering a final
purpose of value. The hones hummed from time to time,
for the busy knives needed constant sharpening. Their
cutting edge turned away from the workwoman and to it
she brought the material&mdash;fragments of every garment
ever manufactured from spun cotton.</p>

<p>The history of many a single rag had been a feminine
epic, from its plucking in a far off cotton field to its
creation, use, adventures, triumphs, tragedies and final
dissolution. Here they were from the dust heaps of a
continent, from the embracing of bodies noble and simple,
high and low, young and old, sweet and foul.</p>

<p>Their tags and buttons were swiftly cut away and each
grille exhibited a strange assortment of trophies&mdash;pearl
and glass, metal and foil, whalebone and indiarubber.
Even so many foreign substances escaped the sorters, to
be captured at a later period in the purification of the rag.</p>

<p>The women sat back to back and there was little speech
among them. Their hands twinkled in a sort of rhythmic
measure from right to left and left to right. Then, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
their baskets were filled, came Alice Barefoot to carry
them away and pile fresh accumulations from the thresher.</p>

<p>To-day the work was old rag; but sometimes a consignment
of fragments and overplus from the collar and
shirt factories arrived clean and white. Out of them
had garments been cut and the remnants needed nothing
but shortening and dismemberment upon the knives and
picking over for coloured threads, or rubbish that hang
about them.</p>

<p>Here reigned Lydia and herself worked at a lattice with
the rest. She had only come to the Mill when her husband
died; but her skill proved great and her influence greater.
Blind-folded she could have done her sorting and separated
by touch the cotton, or linen, from any other textile fabric.
She was clad in a big white garment and had wrapped her
head and neck in a pale blue handkerchief so that her face
only appeared.</p>

<p>Next to her sat a girl, and sometimes they spoke.</p>

<p>Daisy Finch was a big blonde maiden, a friend of Medora&rsquo;s;
and concerning Medora the pair kept up a fitful
conversation. But Lydia&rsquo;s eyes were about her while her
hands swiftly ran through the rags. She marked all that
was going on from her place at the end of the row, and
sometimes cried out a direction, or word of admonition.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She don&rsquo;t tell me nothing,&rdquo; said Daisy. &ldquo;She just
leaves you with a sort of general feeling she ain&rsquo;t happy,
then she&rsquo;ll turn it off and say, &lsquo;talk of something else,&rsquo;
though all the time we haven&rsquo;t been talking of anything
in particular. Of course it ain&rsquo;t anybody&rsquo;s business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nobody&rsquo;s and everybody&rsquo;s,&rdquo; declared Lydia; &ldquo;but
nobody&rsquo;s in the sense that you can meddle directly in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They was made for each other you might say&mdash;such
a laughing thing as Medora used to be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You never know who&rsquo;s made for each other till they
come to be fit together. And then life wears down the
edges with married people most times, like it do with a
new set of false teeth. Keep her good luck before Me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>dora.
Remind her, when you get a chance, how fortunate
she is. Life&rsquo;s gone so easy with her that she takes for
granted a lot she ought to take with gratitude.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a passing worry I dare say,&rdquo; suggested
Daisy. &ldquo;When she forgets herself, she&rsquo;ll often laugh
and chatter in the old way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, she&rsquo;s fonder of you than most, so you help her
to forget herself as often as you can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Daisy promised to do so and the elder thanked her.</p>

<p>When the bell rang, they stopped work, and while some,
Lydia among them, went to their baskets for dinner, most
flung off their overalls, donned hats and jackets and hurried
home.</p>

<p>As for Mrs. Trivett, she stopped in the shop, ate her
meal, then produced a newspaper and read while others
talked.</p>

<p>The day was fine and warm and many groups took their
food together in the sun round about the Mill.</p>

<p>Outside the vat house were Jordan Kellock and Robert
Life, another vatman, while the new-comer, Philander
Knox, ate his dinner beside them. On a bench at hand,
Medora and Ned shared the contents of their basket, and
the talk ran up and down.</p>

<p>Mr. Knox had won permanent employment without difficulty.
Indeed he proved a paper maker of the first rank,
and while Mr. Trood deprecated Knox&rsquo;s very unusual
stroke, he admitted that the result was as good as possible.</p>

<p>Of this matter they were now speaking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ernest Trood is a great formalist,&rdquo; said Kellock.
&ldquo;He believes in what you may call tradition and a sort
of stroke that you&rsquo;d say was the perfection of the craft.
But you can&rsquo;t make a man to a model. You can show
him another man who works on a good pattern&mdash;no
more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The stroke comes just like every other stroke,
whether it&rsquo;s cricket, or billiards, or shooting, I reckon,&rdquo;
said Ned Dingle. &ldquo;It comes, or else it don&rsquo;t come. Take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
me: I&rsquo;ve tried a score of times to make paper; but I
can&rsquo;t do it. I can&rsquo;t get the stroke. But you might have
an apprentice new to it and find, after a month or two,
he&rsquo;d prove himself in the way to be a paper maker.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Knox, who had already won a friendly greeting
from his new associates, in virtue of an amiable character
and humorous disposition, admitted that the vatman was
born, not made.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you may very near say as much for the beaterman,&rdquo;
he added. &ldquo;I never want to see better pulp than
you send down to the vat room, Ned Dingle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis the life and soul of the paper to have such pulp
as yours, Ned,&rdquo; confirmed Kellock, and the beater was
pleased. Praise always excited Ned and made him chatter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what there is to it&mdash;just thoroughness
no doubt and a keen eye and no scamping of the tests.
I take a lot more tests than most beaters I reckon,&rdquo; he
said.</p>

<p>They discussed their craft and Ned told how for the
purposes of the new water-mark pictures destined for a
forthcoming exhibition, extraordinary pulp would be necessary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Soft as milk it will have to be,&rdquo; he declared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen the like,&rdquo; said Knox. &ldquo;Stuff you&rsquo;d think
couldn&rsquo;t hold together. It&rsquo;s got to find every tiny crevice
of the mould; but such pulp takes the dyes exceeding
well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our dyes are Trenchard&rsquo;s secret,&rdquo; answered Dingle.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a great chemist, as a paper master needs to be.
I&rsquo;d give a lot to look in the laboratory; but only Trood
goes there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A very understanding foreman is Ernest Trood,&rdquo;
admitted Mr. Knox; then he turned to Medora.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s they fingers?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You knock your fingers about
rattling them against the crib.&rdquo;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>&ldquo;The fingers always suffer,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;For my
part I shake when there&rsquo;s a spell of very hot pulp for the
thick papers. I&rsquo;m feared of my life the skin will go
somewhere and put me out of action for a bit. If some
man could invent a possible glove, many a tender-skinned
vatman would bless him. But a glove would kill the
stroke no doubt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dingle pressed more food from their basket on Medora
and the well meant action apparently annoyed her. What
passed between them was not heard, save the last words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a fool,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I have my own
way even in that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; replied Ned. &ldquo;Have it as you will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But she grew angry; her face lowered and she pressed
her lips together.</p>

<p>The others joked and Mr. Knox offered Medora a piece
of pie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hard hearted devil, you are, Dingle,&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;To eat the cheese and offer your poor girl the bread.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Medora jumped up and at the same moment Daisy
Finch came along to seek her. They departed together
and strolled from the works up the valley.</p>

<p>But Ned Dingle was evidently disturbed. His face had
fallen and he lit his pipe and went slowly after the women.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take my tip and leave her alone,&rdquo; shouted Knox;
then he caught sight of Kellock&rsquo;s perturbed countenance
and turned to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t they good friends?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course they are&mdash;none better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sometimes a bit of chaff makes a breeze end in laughter,&rdquo;
said the elder; &ldquo;and sometimes it don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chaff&rsquo;s a ticklish thing,&rdquo; answered Jordan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To you it might be, because you&rsquo;re one of the serious
sort, that never see much to laugh at in anything,&rdquo; retorted
Philander; &ldquo;but that&rsquo;s your loss. Alice Barefoot
in the rag house is the same. Can&rsquo;t see a joke and mistook
my fun yesterday for rudeness. I might have known by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
her eye she weren&rsquo;t a laughter-loving creature. But Mrs.
Dingle can laugh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She laughs when there&rsquo;s anything to laugh at,&rdquo; said
Kellock drily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The art is to find something to laugh at in everything,&rdquo;
explained Philander Knox. &ldquo;And married people
ought to practice that for their own salvation more
than any.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How is it you ain&rsquo;t married?&rdquo; asked Robert Life.
He was a man of few words and his wife worked in the
glazing house with Medora.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For the very good reason that my wife&rsquo;s dead,&rdquo; replied
Mr. Knox. She&rsquo;s left me for a better place and
better company&mdash;a very excellent wife according to her
lights, and I missed her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dare say you&rsquo;ll find another here,&rdquo; suggested a man
who had come along a minute before. It was Henry
Barefoot, Alice&rsquo;s brother, the boilerman&mdash;an old sailor,
who had drifted into the Mill when his service days were
done.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I do, Henry, it won&rsquo;t be your sister, so don&rsquo;t throw
out no hopes,&rdquo; answered Knox.</p>

<p>Henry laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No man ever offered for her and no man ever will,&rdquo;
he declared. &ldquo;Her pride is to do man&rsquo;s work and she
never will do woman&rsquo;s&mdash;not if all the men in Devon went
on their knees to her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve known others the same,&rdquo; declared Philander.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re neuter bees, to say it kindly, and they hum so
terrible sorrowful over their toil that the male give &rsquo;em a
wide berth. Duty&rsquo;s their watchword; and they do it in a
way to make us common people hate the word.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Alice. You know the sort seemingly,&rdquo; said
Henry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve met with &rsquo;em. They are scattered about. I used
to pity &rsquo;em till I found there wasn&rsquo;t no need. They&rsquo;re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
quite satisfied with themselves for the most part, but seldom
satisfied with other people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alice is a withering woman, though a very good housekeeper
and looks after me very well,&rdquo; said Mr. Barefoot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As housekeepers they can&rsquo;t be beaten,&rdquo; admitted the
other. &ldquo;But Mrs. Dingle is a very different pattern&mdash;a
pretty creature&mdash;prettiest I&rsquo;ve seen for a month of
Sundays. They pretty women are exacting in marriage,
because nine times out of ten they&rsquo;ve been spoiled before.
She looks to me as though she wanted something she ain&rsquo;t
got.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dingle don&rsquo;t know what she wants, for in a minute
of temper he told me so,&rdquo; said Mr. Life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t he? Then you tell him to be quick and find
out,&rdquo; advised Philander, &ldquo;because with a rare piece like
that, if he don&rsquo;t, some other young fellow very likely
will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Kellock spoke, for this sentiment seemed outrageous
to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can you say such an indecent thing!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;A man of your age ought to know better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A man of your age perhaps don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; answered Mr.
Knox. &ldquo;And yet you&rsquo;re old enough to know the meaning
of a pretty girl. But I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;re one of those
chaps that&rsquo;s had some useful things left out of him, Kellock.
You ain&rsquo;t called &lsquo;Jordan&rsquo; for nothing I expect.
No doubt you wouldn&rsquo;t wish to comfort Mrs. Dingle; but
then you&rsquo;re not everybody, and other young men might
feel called to cheer her up&mdash;no more than that of course.
And why you should flush so red and use the word &lsquo;indecent&rsquo;
to such a decent man as me, I can&rsquo;t guess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You would if you knew more about it, however,&rdquo; said
Henry Barefoot. &ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t up in our history yet, else
you&rsquo;d understand that Kellock here was one of the &lsquo;also
ran&rsquo; lot after Medora Dingle. No offence, Jordan&mdash;of
course such things can&rsquo;t be hid.&rdquo;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>&ldquo;You oughtn&rsquo;t to talk about such private matters,
Barefoot,&rdquo; answered Kellock calmly, &ldquo;and a conversation
like this is improper, and for my part I don&rsquo;t wish to hear
any more of it. No self-respecting man would pry into
such a delicate subject.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s prying?&rdquo; asked Philander. &ldquo;I merely say,
from my knowledge of human beings in general, that if a
pretty young woman&rsquo;s not happy and her husband hasn&rsquo;t
got the trick to make her so, &rsquo;tis almost any odds some
other chap will come along and have a try. That&rsquo;s what
would happen in most Christian countries anyway&mdash;whether
Devonshire&rsquo;s different I don&rsquo;t know, being a
stranger to these parts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We men mind our own business in Devonshire,&rdquo; said
Kellock, and Knox answered promptly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m right,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;because a pretty girl down
on her luck is every man&rsquo;s business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll get a fright I dare say,&rdquo; prophesied Robert
Life. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve known more than one young married woman,
restless like, who ran a bit of risk; but as a rule their
eyes are opened in time and the husband makes good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kellock, heartily loathing this conversation, left the
others, and when he was gone, Life explained to Mr. Knox
the situation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Another man might be dangerous,&rdquo; said Henry Barefoot,
&ldquo;for by all accounts Medora liked him very well and
was in two minds to the last which she&rsquo;d take. But Kellock&rsquo;s
a good and sober creature and a great respecter
of law and order. You can trust him not to break out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You speak as a bachelor and your sister&rsquo;s brother,
Henry,&rdquo; answered Philander. &ldquo;Where there&rsquo;s a woman
and a man that once loved her, you can no more trust
either of &rsquo;em not to break out than you can trust a spring
in autumn. Kellock&rsquo;s clearly a virtuous soul, and he certainly
won&rsquo;t break out if he can help it. You can see by
his eyes he&rsquo;s not a lady&rsquo;s man, and never will be in any
large and generous sense. But so much the more danger,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
for where that sort dines they sleeps when love&rsquo;s the trouble.
Let them love once and they&rsquo;ll love for ever, no
matter what happens; and if she was fool enough to go
playing about with him, she might overthrow him to his
own loss in the long run.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These forebodings were cut short by the work bell and
Mr. Knox, expressing a hope that he might be mistaken,
shook out his pipe and followed Robert back into the vat
room.</p>

<small>THE MARTYR</small></h2></div>


<p>On a Saturday afternoon full of sunshine was presented
the rich but simple picture of Ashprington village under
conditions of autumn. The hamlet lay on a slope under
a hillcrest and through it fell steep paths by meadow
and orchard past the cottages to Bow Bridge far distant
in the vale.</p>

<p>Crowning Ashprington rose the church-tower of uniform
grey, battlemented, with a great poplar standing
on its right, and a yew tree throwing shadow upon the
western porch. Then fell the land abruptly, and the whole
foreground was filled with an apple orchard, that rippled
to the churchyard walls and spread a rich cloth of scarlet
and gold around them.</p>

<p>At this hour the tree-foundered village seemed oppressed
and smothered with falling leaves. Its over-abundant timber
mastered the place and flung down foliage in such
immense masses that the roads and alleys, drinking fountain,
little gardens subtending the street and the roofs of
the cottages were all choked with them.</p>

<p>But it was a dry and joyous hour, the latter rains had
yet to fall and submerge Ashprington in mud and decay.
Virginian creeper flamed on the house fronts and dahlias,
michaelmas daisies and chrysanthemums still flaunted in
the gardens.</p>

<p>Through this cheerful scene came Miss Finch and Medora
Dingle with their baskets to pick blackberries. Medora&rsquo;s
home was a stone&rsquo;s throw from the church and
they now crossed the churchyard to enter certain fields
beyond it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>The well-kept sward spread level with the arms of the
apple trees over the wall, for the ground fell sharply from
the graveyard to the orchard below; and now, at the
limits of the burial place, cider apples fell on the graves
and spattered their mounds and flat surfaces with gold.</p>

<p>Daisy stopped at a tomb and removed a windfall of
fruit from the broken marble chips that covered it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s old Mr. Kellock,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t
like them there, would he&mdash;such a thrifty old man as
he was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And such a tidy one,&rdquo; added Medora.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was Mr. Jordan&rsquo;s grandfather and left him all his
money I believe,&rdquo; continued Daisy; but her friend knew
more about that matter than she did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He hadn&rsquo;t anything to leave over and above his cottage.
That was left to Jordan Kellock and he sold it,
not wanting to be troubled with house property. It wasn&rsquo;t
worth much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They passed through the shining fruit trees and stopped
to admire them; then Medora, since Mr. Kellock had been
mentioned, felt she might return to that subject.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I often wonder what he&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You feel
that he won&rsquo;t be content to stop at Dene all his life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked Daisy. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got proper good
money and is a big man here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d be a big man anywhere,&rdquo; answered Medora.
&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t only a matter of wages with him,&rdquo; she added.
&ldquo;Of course we know as a vatman he&rsquo;s one of the best in
England, and makes as good paper as there is in the world,
I suppose. But he&rsquo;s got more to him than that, Daisy.
He&rsquo;s not content with being prosperous and well-thought
of. He thinks great thoughts and has great ambitions.
I dare say the people here don&rsquo;t see that, for he&rsquo;s a cut
above the most of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is,&rdquo; admitted Daisy. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something, I don&rsquo;t
know what about him; but it makes me uncomfortable
with him.&rdquo;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just his greatness acting on you,&rdquo; explained
Medora. &ldquo;I felt like that once too, but he did me the
kindness to explain himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We all know he would have given all he&rsquo;d got to marry
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak about that. At any rate I understand
him better than any other woman&mdash;or man for that matter.
And though it wasn&rsquo;t to be, I understand him still;
and I know he&rsquo;s out for big things sooner or later. He&rsquo;ll
make a mark in the world of labour some day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Daisy looked with admiration at Medora.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I shouldn&rsquo;t know what to answer if he talked
to me about such deep subjects,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But then
you&rsquo;re married, and you&rsquo;ve always got a man in the house
to help your brain power.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Medora, secretly nettled at the preposterous suggestion
of Ned enlarging her mental outlook, turned to the blackberries
and felt a helpless disappointment that even her
friend should guess so little of her difficulties and troubles.
For now she began day by day to weave round herself and
her married life a hollow and false tissue of imaginary
tribulations and trials supposed to be sprung from her
union with Edward Dingle. Medora set about a sort of
histrionics inspired by nothing but her own vague unrest
and her own amazing ignorance of reality. Even to herself
she could not explain this futile experiment in emotions,
yet she persisted and presently, finding certain of
her circle were deceived, and even hearing words of pity
on a woman&rsquo;s lips, she deluded herself as to the truth of
her gathering misfortunes and assured her conscience that
the disaster came from without and not within. For at
first, in the perpetration of this stupid pose, conscience
pricked before Ned&rsquo;s puzzled eyes; but presently, when a
silly woman told Medora that she was a martyr, this nonsense
of her own brewing seemed indeed the bitter drink
life had set to her lips. She echoed and amplified the
notion of martyrdom. It was just what she wanted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
excuse her own folly to herself. From accepting the idea,
she soon began to credit it. To win the full flavour of the
make-believe this was necessary. Then developed the spectacle
of a masquerading woman, herself creating the atmosphere
in which she desired her world to see her suffer
and shine.</p>

<p>As all who acquire a taste for martyrdom, Medora
proved amazingly ingenious in plaiting the scourges and
selecting the members of the inquisition from her own
household. She had reached a preliminary stage in this
weak-minded pastime and enjoyed it exceedingly. Ned
was much mystified; but the attitude of Ned mattered
little. Her real object and the goal of the game lay far
beyond Ned. Whereunto all this would lead, Medora did
not know; and she told herself that she did not care.</p>

<p>The day was to add a considerable scene to her unfolding
drama, though Mrs. Dingle did not guess it when she
set out. She had no premonition of the interesting adventure
that awaited her when presently she drifted, by
hedgerows and lanes, somewhat westward of Ashprington,
upon the high road to Totnes.</p>

<p>They were filling their baskets, and for a time Medora
had forgotten all about herself and was taking a healthy
interest in Daisy&rsquo;s suspicions concerning a young man
who worked at Dene Mill, when a bicycle bell warned them
and there flashed along upon his way home, Jordan Kellock.</p>

<p>He stopped and they showed him their blackberries and
invited him to help himself. Then, together they walked
homeward and Medora became concerned to part from
Daisy if possible. An opportunity occurred ere long and
when the elder pointed out that Miss Finch would gain
half a mile by a short cut, her friend took the hint.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My basket&rsquo;s heavy and you&rsquo;ve got company, so I&rsquo;ll
go this way home,&rdquo; said Daisy with great tact. Then she
bade them good-bye and descended a steep lane to Bow
Bridge.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>Immediately she had gone, Medora&rsquo;s manner changed
from cheerfulness to a more pensive mien.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sometimes it&rsquo;s so hard to pretend you&rsquo;re happy,&rdquo; she
explained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry you&rsquo;ve got to pretend,&rdquo; he answered.</p>

<p>He had fought awhile against any sort of secret understanding
with Medora, but something of the kind now
existed, though Jordan could not have explained how it
had come about. It seemed not unnatural, however, because
he knew the woman so well and felt so supremely
interested in her happiness. He believed, in his youthful
inexperience, that he might be able to help both Ned and
Medora by virtue of his brains and good sense; and he
imagined that his championship of Medora, so to call it,
emanated entirely from his own will to right and justice.
Had anybody hinted to him that Medora was amusing herself
with this very delicate material, he must have refused
to believe it. He believed in her good faith as he believed
in the stars, and he trusted himself completely for a man
above the power of temptation. Indeed, as yet he had felt
none.</p>

<p>To-day, however, the young woman went further than
she had ventured to go.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can talk to you, Jordan, and I often thank God I
can,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;because there&rsquo;s nobody else on earth&mdash;not
one who understands me like you do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not in the ear of him who really understands her does a
woman ever confess to be understood; but the listener quite
agreed with Medora and believed the truth of what she
asserted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If thought and true friendship could make me understand,
then I do,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Ned&rsquo;s such a real good
chap at heart that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not,&rdquo; she said positively. &ldquo;To my bitter grief
I know he&rsquo;s not. Like you, I thought so, and I made myself
go on thinking so, for loyalty; but it&rsquo;s no good pretending
that any more. He&rsquo;s deceived you as he has me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
He&rsquo;s not good hearted, for all his laughter and noise, else
he wouldn&rsquo;t persecute me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going into details,&rdquo; declared Medora, quite
aware that there were no details to go into; &ldquo;but he&rsquo;s that
rough and harsh. Loses his temper if you look at him.
He wasn&rsquo;t like you, and showed me everything about himself
when we were courting. He hid the things that matter,
and if I&rsquo;d known then half, or a quarter, of what I
know now, I wouldn&rsquo;t have taken him, Jordan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that,&rdquo; he begged again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to say it. And I&rsquo;ll say more. It&rsquo;s a relief to
speak where your honesty is known, and no false meaning
is put to your words. I&rsquo;ll say this, that I made a dreadful
mistake, and every year that goes over my head will show it
clearer. I can bear it, of course. We women are built to
suffer and keep our mouths shut. It&rsquo;s only men that run
about with their troubles. Yes, I can bear it, Jordan, and
I shall bear it to my grave; but it&rsquo;s hard for a girl of my
age to look ahead through all the years of her life and see
nothing but dust and ashes. And though I&rsquo;m brave
enough to face it, I&rsquo;m too frank and open-natured to hide
it, and the bitter thing is that people guess that I&rsquo;m not
happy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t put it as strongly as that, Medora. Don&rsquo;t actually
say you&rsquo;re an unhappy woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re either happy, or else you&rsquo;re not&mdash;at any rate,
when you&rsquo;re young,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I see the old get into a
sort of frozen condition sooner or later, when they&rsquo;re
neither one nor the other, being sunk to a kind of state like
a turnip in ground; but the young are different. They
feel. Why, Daisy, only a few minutes ago, saw my mind
was troubled, though I tried ever so to hide it. You know
people know it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t deny that. Everybody&rsquo;s more or less sorry.
But between husband and wife, of course, no wise man or
woman ventures to come.&rdquo;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>&ldquo;Yes, they do,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;My own mother for
one. Kindness made alive to everybody else no doubt, but
not to me. She doesn&rsquo;t blame my husband anyway, so she
must blame me, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t say that. It may be no matter for blame&mdash;just
the point of view. The great thing is to get at a
person&rsquo;s point of view, Medora.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t I try? Don&rsquo;t I interest myself in Ned?
I&rsquo;ve got a brain, Jordan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know that very well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I can&rsquo;t help seeing only too bitter clear, that my
husband&rsquo;s not interested in anything that wants brains to
it. He&rsquo;s all for sport and talk and pleasure. I like to
think about interesting subjects&mdash;human nature and
progress, and the future of labour, and so on. And if I
try to talk about anything that really matters, he just
yawns and starts on shooting birds and football. For the
less brains a person has got, the more they want to be
chattering. I&rsquo;ve married a boy in fact, when I thought
I&rsquo;d married a man; and my charge against Ned is that he
hid the truth of himself from me, and made me think he was
interested in what interested me, when he was not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She had mentioned the subjects which she knew attracted
Jordan. It was indeed his wearisome insistence on
such things that had made her turn of old to the less intelligent
and more ingenuous Dingle. In reality she had no
mind for abstractions or social problems.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As we grow older, we naturally go for the subjects that
matter,&rdquo; said Kellock. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always wanted to leave the
world better than I found it, you know, Medora.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so you will&mdash;you&rsquo;re built to do it,&rdquo; declared she.
&ldquo;And I shall watch you do it, Jordan. And though I&rsquo;ve
lost it all, I shall see some other woman at your right hand
helping you to make a name in the world. And I shall
envy her&mdash;yes, I shall. I can say that to you, because I
can trust you never to repeat it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shake me up to the roots of my being when you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
talk like this,&rdquo; he assured her. &ldquo;Oh, my God, Medora, it
seems a cruel sort of thing that just at the critical time,
and before it was too late, you couldn&rsquo;t have seen and felt
what you see and feel now. It was bad enough then.
You&rsquo;ll never know or guess what I felt when you had to
say &lsquo;no&rsquo; to me. But I had one thing to keep me going
then&mdash;the certainty you were too clever to make a mistake.
I said to myself a million times: &lsquo;She knows best;
she knows that Dingle will make her a happier woman than
I could.&rsquo; But now&mdash;now&mdash;when you say what you&rsquo;ve
said. Where am I now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They talked in this emotional strain for ten minutes, and
she wove with native art a web of which both warp and
woof were absurdly unreal. Her nature was such that in
a task of this sort she succeeded consummately. By a
thousand little touches&mdash;sighs, looks, and shakes or
droops of the head&mdash;she contributed to her comedy.
She abounded in suggestions. Her eyes fell, her sentences
were left unfinished. Then came heroic touches, and a
brave straight glance with resolution to take up the staggering
weight of her cross and bear it worthily to the end.</p>

<p>Medora was charming, and in her subconscious soul she
knew that her performance carried conviction in every
word and gesture. She revelled in her acting, and rejoiced
in the effect it occasioned on the listener. Long ago, Kellock
had set her, as she guessed, as a lovely fly in amber,
never to change, though now for ever out of his reach.
He had accepted his loss, but he continued to regard her as
his perfect woman, and she cherished the fact as a great
possession. Perhaps, had it been otherwise, she had not
entered upon her present perilous adventure; but she knew
that Jordan Kellock was a knight of weak causes, and one
who always fought for the oppressed, when in his power to
do so; and now she had created a phantom of oppression,
which his bent of mind and attitude to herself prevented
him from recognising as largely unreal.</p>

<p>Kellock was young; he had loved Medora in the full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
measure of a reserved nature, and to-day she deluded him
to the limit of his possibilities. Her complete triumph indeed
almost frightened her. For a few moments he became
as earnestly concerned as on the great occasion when he
had asked her to marry him. Then she calmed the man
down, and told him that he must not waste his time on her
troubles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s selfish of me to tell you these things&mdash;perhaps it&rsquo;s
wrong,&rdquo; she said, truly enough; but he would not grant
that. His emotion was intense; his pain genuine. Her
intuition told her that here was a man who might err&mdash;if
ever he erred&mdash;in just such a situation as she was creating.
She was surprised to find the ease with which it was
possible to rouse him, and felt this discovery enough for
that day. She grew elated, but uneasy at the unexpected
power she possessed. Her sense of humour even spoke in a
still, small voice, for humour she had.</p>

<p>Chance helped her to end the scene, and, a hundred yards
from home, Ned himself appeared with his gun over his
shoulder and a hare in his hand.</p>

<p>Dingle was in cheerful spirits.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A proper afternoon I&rsquo;ve had,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Ernest
Trood asked me to go out shooting along with him and
some friends, and we&rsquo;ve enjoyed sport, I promise you. A
rare mixed bag. We began in the bottom above the Mill,
and got a woodcock first go off, and then we worked up and
had a brace and a half of partridges, a brace of pheasants,
and a hare, and eight rabbits. I knew what you&rsquo;d like,
Medora, and I took a partridge, and the hare for my
lot. I shot them, and four rabbits and one of the
pheasants.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a chap for killing you are,&rdquo; said Jordan, while
Ned dragged a partridge from his pocket and handed it to
his wife.</p>

<p>Nobody loved nice things better than she, but she took
the bird pensively and stroked its grey and russet feathers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor little bird, your troubles are ended,&rdquo; she said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
Then she assumed a cheerful air, which struck Jordan as
unspeakably pathetic.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been busy, too. Look at my blackberries.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ned praised the blackberries, and in his usual impulsive
fashion offered Kellock the hare; but Jordan declined it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thrown away upon me,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come and help us to eat it one night then,&rdquo; suggested
Dingle, and Medora echoed his wish.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re very kind. I&rsquo;ll come up to supper
any evening, if you mean it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he mounted his bicycle and rode off down the hill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He came along from Totnes, while Daisy and I were
picking blackberries, and he stopped and would carry my
basket for me,&rdquo; she explained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He looked a bit down in the mouth, didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was. He&rsquo;s such a man to feel other people&rsquo;s
troubles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whose? Not yours, I should hope?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good powers, no! I&rsquo;m not one to tell my troubles&mdash;you
know that, or ought to. I&rsquo;m a proud woman, whatever
you may be. It isn&rsquo;t personal things, but general
questions that bother him. Poverty and want and injustice,
and all that. I cheered him up, and tried to make him
forget.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll do better to leave such subjects alone,&rdquo; said Dingle.
&ldquo;The woes of the world in general ain&rsquo;t his job; and
if he tries to make them his job, he may find it won&rsquo;t pay
him to do so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s your pettifogging opinion; but if every man in
good employment was as selfish as you, the poor might
remain poor for ever,&rdquo; she answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t you be a fool, anyway, there&rsquo;s a dear.
You&rsquo;ve got to look after me, not the poor in general. And
nobody can look after me better than you, when you please.
It&rsquo;s a choice between beer and tea this minute, so choose
which I&rsquo;m to have.&rdquo;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>&ldquo;Tea,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If you can be patient for a little.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They went in together, and he was pleased to find Medora
amiable and willing, though ignorant that her good
temper sprang not from his inspiration.</p>

<small>THE BLUE MARK</small></h2></div>


<p>From the rag house, through trap doors, the rag descended
from Lydia and her fellow workers to a huge object like a
mowing machine. The rags came to this monster and
passed through its whirling knives. Then, having been
clipped pretty small, they were carried on an endless ribbon
up again to the magnet. Two great magnetized rollers
revolved, and, in a dingy niagara, every fraction of
the old rag tumbled over them, to run an electric gauntlet
and receive a challenge. The bossy rollers were even
quicker than the women&rsquo;s fingers, and a fraction of metal,
however small, responded to their attraction instantly.
There was a click and instead of falling with its neighbours,
the offending rag found itself arrested and pilloried on a
boss. It clung to the roller, and, as the cylinder turned,
became de-magnetized again and fell in a place apart.
The danger to future processes was thus lessened materially
and but little foreign matter in shape of metal escaped
to be a nuisance later on.</p>

<p>To the duster then came the harassed rag and in open
wire barrels amid revolving wooden prongs it was whirled
round and round and further cleansed.</p>

<p>Then to Henry Barefoot it went, and Henry always declared
that in his hands the material received first serious
treatment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The rag don&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s born till it gets to the boilerman,&rdquo;
he was wont to say.</p>

<p>The boiler-house lay under an arched roof of corrugated
iron. It was a damp place, full of hot air and the heavy
scent of washing. The steam thinned and feathered away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
through holes in the roof. In the floor were deep square
hollows and here the boilers revolved, with a solemnity
proper to their size. They were huge metal receptacles
capable of holding a ton each; and when the rag was
packed, with water and alkalies to cleanse it, the loaded
giant turned ponderously over and over, churning the mass
for three or four hours. Then the seething clouts were
dragged forth, their pollutions drained away and further
stages of lustration entered upon.</p>

<p>Thus far the rag had come under rough control and
reign of law. By air and water and chastening of many
blows it was reduced to a limp and sodden condition, amenable
to discipline, more or less prepared for the tremendous
processes between its final disintegration as rag and its
apotheosis as paper.</p>

<p>A paper man will tell you he turns &ldquo;old shirts into new
sheets&rdquo;: and that indeed is what he does; but a long and
toilsome journey lies between the old shirt and its apotheosis.</p>

<p>Henry Barefoot was a placid man, as long as the rag
came to him exactly when he wanted it. Under ordinary
circumstances he accomplished his part in the great machine
as obscurely as any invisible wheel, or steam pipe.
But if the women delayed, or he was &ldquo;hung up,&rdquo; as he put
it, then his chivalry broke down and he swore long and
loud at those who interfered with his activities. At such
times he became tragic and exceedingly profane. He expanded
and broke into uncouth gestures and simian scowls.
He appealed to Heaven in these great moments and asked
of the sky why women had been created. Sometimes his
sister, Alice, was sent for from the thresher to pacify him,
and when she failed, Lydia Trivett, at the sound of
Henry&rsquo;s roaring in the boiler-house, would slip from her
lattice and strive to calm his fury.</p>

<p>The women had fled before him at one of these explosions
and Alice having also failed, approached Mrs. Trivett and
begged her to intervene.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>She went, to find Mr. Barefoot standing with steam
about him and his hand lifted to the corrugated iron roof
above his grey head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, my God, my God!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What have I done
to be the prey of a lot of worthless females&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your rag&rsquo;s waiting, Henry,&rdquo; interrupted Lydia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;His rag&rsquo;s out, I should think,&rdquo; said a woman from
behind Lydia. &ldquo;An evil-speaking toad&mdash;always blasting
us. And how can we help it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know very well, Henry, there must be a hitch
sometimes with such a lot of dirty rag,&rdquo; explained Lydia.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve all got to keep going, and it&rsquo;s no more good or
sense cussing us than it is for them in the engine house to
cuss you. And men wouldn&rsquo;t do this work half as well as
women, as you&rsquo;d very soon find if we were gone. And it&rsquo;s
a very ill-convenient thing for you to lose your temper,
and nobody will be sorrier than you in an hour&rsquo;s time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the rag now awaited him, Henry subsided.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a plot against me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve no quarrel
with you, Lydia. It ain&rsquo;t your department. It&rsquo;s they
baggering women at the magnet, and they want for me to
get the sack as I very well know. But they&rsquo;ll get fired
themselves&mdash;every trollop of &rsquo;em&mdash;afore I shall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t want you to get fired. Why should they?
What have you done to them? Why, you haven&rsquo;t even
asked one of &rsquo;em to marry you,&rdquo; said Lydia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;they needn&rsquo;t hope that,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
seen too much of woman since I came here ever to want
one for my own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the breeze subsided and Henry filled his empty boiler,
growling himself back to his usual calm the while. It was
characteristic of him that between these dynamic discharges,
he preserved an amiable attitude to those among
whom he worked, and when a storm had passed, he instantly
resumed friendly relations.</p>

<p>Within an hour of this scene, when dinner time came, he
descended to the ground floor and cautioned two girls who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
were skipping off down a flight of steps that led from the
rag house to the ground below.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you go so fast,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;When slate steps
are wet with rain, they&rsquo;re beastly slippery, and some day
one of you maidens will fall and break yourselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Trivett put on her old black bonnet, for she was
going out to dinner with another woman; but as she prepared
to depart, her son-in-law met her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s important,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I want half an hour with
you, mother, and I dare say Mrs. Ford won&rsquo;t mind if you
go along with her to-morrow instead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Ford made no difficulty and Lydia returned to the
rag house with Ned, who brought his meal with him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a tid-bit for you here,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;A bit
of jugged hare which you&rsquo;ll like. And I wouldn&rsquo;t trouble
you but for a very good reason.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They sat in a corner among some rag bales, beyond earshot
of others who were eating their meal in the rag house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Medora?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Trivett.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s having dinner in the glazing room to-day. So I
took the opportunity. It&rsquo;s about her I want to talk. But
eat first. I don&rsquo;t want to spoil the jugged hare.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He brought out a small pudding basin containing the
delicacy and his mother-in-law ate heartily and declared
the dish very good.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Medora can cook, whatever she can&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; said Lydia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing she can&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;but
there&rsquo;s a damned lot of things she won&rsquo;t do. And that&rsquo;s
the trouble to me. Time was when we saw alike every way
and never had a word or a difference of opinion; but that
time&rsquo;s past seemingly, and I want to know why; and if you
know, I wish you&rsquo;d tell me. It&rsquo;s all in a nutshell so far as
I can see. What am I doing to vex her? God&rsquo;s my judge
I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;m the same as I always have been. A
chap like me don&rsquo;t change. I only want to be patient and
cheerful and go on with my life as I&rsquo;m going. It&rsquo;s her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
that&rsquo;s changed. She used to love a bit of fun and laughter
and be friendly and easy-going and jolly and kind.
That&rsquo;s what she was when I married her anyway. But
she&rsquo;s changed and I&rsquo;m getting fairly fed up, because I don&rsquo;t
know of any fault in myself to explain it. If I&rsquo;d pretended
to be different from what I am before we were married and
deceived her in anything, then she&rsquo;d have a case against me.
But nobody can say I did. She knew just what I was, and
I thought I knew just what she was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did, Ned,&rdquo; said Mrs. Trivett earnestly. &ldquo;You
take my word that you did know just what she was. And
what she was, she is still under her skin. She can&rsquo;t change
really, any more than you can, or anybody else. She took
you because you suited her and she knew she&rsquo;d be happy
with you. And what&rsquo;s happening to her just now is a
passing thing calling for patience. Women have their
funny moods and whims&mdash;Medora like the rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I grant that, but how long is it going to last? I
know they get queer in their heads sometimes, but she&rsquo;s
down in the mouth always now. I can&rsquo;t pleasure her, do
what I may, and the things that always delighted her a
year ago bore her now. Damn it! She looks at me sometimes
as if she was a schoolmistress and I was a wicked
boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like this with her; and it&rsquo;s the same with lots of
people who have had nothing but a good time all their
lives. Instead of knowing their luck, they take their luck
to be just the usual state of things, and they don&rsquo;t look
round and see the scores of people without their good fortune:
they only fancy that other people are more fortunate
than them. They get so bored with the good that they
begin to picture something better. Everybody wants better
bread than is made of wheat sometimes, and especially
them that have never tasted worse. We, that have had to
eat barley bread, know our luck&mdash;t&rsquo;others don&rsquo;t. The
thing for you is to be patient. You&rsquo;re all right and you&rsquo;re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
going on all right so far as I can tell. I&rsquo;ll take your word
of that and I very well understand your difficulties. But
you&rsquo;re a man and you&rsquo;ve got the brains.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She says not,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s one of the nice
things I&rsquo;m called to hear now. She didn&rsquo;t quarrel with
my sense or my nonsense a year ago. Now she says right
out that she wishes I had more intellects. Not a very nice
thing to hear. I might be a stone-breaker, or a hedge-tacker
with no sense at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be patient with her. It&rsquo;s a whim, and what&rsquo;s responsible
for it I don&rsquo;t know more than you. But it will pass.
She can&rsquo;t go on pretending she&rsquo;s an unhappy woman&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, and she shan&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m only a human
man myself, and it&rsquo;s a proper outrage for her to make out
she&rsquo;s being bullied and evil treated by a chap that worshipped
the ground under her feet and would again. She&rsquo;s
mean, mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Ned, she&rsquo;s foolish; she ain&rsquo;t mean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is mean. List to this. Two night ago Kellock
came to supper with us&mdash;to help eat that jugged hare&mdash;and
the talk was serious to death, as it always is with
him&mdash;him being such a serious man. And presently,
among a lot of other soaring notions, Medora wondered
what was the height of bliss. And she said the height of
bliss was to feel she was doing good, noble work in the
world and helping to make people happier.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Trivett sniffed, but did not respond.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; continued Ned, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say nothing to that,
though it sounded a bit thin to me; but Kellock declared it
was a very grand thought, and for his part the height of
bliss was to feel you&rsquo;d got a move on, and was leaving a
mark and doing solid spade work, that would lift the next
generation to more happiness. And, of course, Medora
purred over that. And then she asked me what my height
of bliss was&mdash;in a pitying tone of voice, as though she
and Jordan belonged to another world. Well, I said my
height of bliss was lying in my new bath-room of a Satur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>day
night, with the hot water up to my chin, thinking of
my savings in the bank.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t, Ned!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did&mdash;just to give &rsquo;em a shake up. And just to remind
Medora I built that bath-room on to my house&mdash;not
because I wanted it, but because she did. Well, I knew
Kellock wouldn&rsquo;t see the joke, because he ain&rsquo;t built to;
but, damn it&mdash;I did think Medora would. I expected
she&rsquo;d laugh and lighten up the talk a bit. But not her.
She pulled a long face, and said I ought to be ashamed to
confess such ideas. And that was mean&mdash;you can&rsquo;t deny
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was,&rdquo; admitted Medora&rsquo;s mother. &ldquo;Her sense of
fun&rsquo;s deserted her; or else she&rsquo;s hiding it of a purpose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Another thing,&rdquo; grumbled Mr. Dingle, &ldquo;that same
night when Kellock was gone, I got a bit angered with her,
God forgive me, and I took her rough by the arm, and it
left a bit of a blue mark on her skin. I very nearly went
on my knees for sorrow after, and she forgave me, and
made it up. Well, you&rsquo;d think a decent woman would
have kept her sleeve down for a day or two till the mark
was gone; but I went to speak to her in the glazing room
yesterday, and there was her forearm bare for all the
women to see, and the chaps at the presses. And when
they asked her how she came by it, as they did, she made
a business of not telling them&mdash;which, of course, did tell
them. And that was mean, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Trivett looked anxious, and put her hand on his
arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you knock her about, Ned. I know how aggravating
a woman can be; but don&rsquo;t you do that. I&rsquo;m not
standing up for her, and I&rsquo;ll talk to her again and try to
show her what she&rsquo;s doing; but don&rsquo;t you give her a shadow
of excuse for this silliness, because, in her present mood,
she&rsquo;ll be very quick to take advantage of it. I know you
very well, and I was properly glad when Medora took you
and not the other, because I knew her, too, and felt she&rsquo;d<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
be happier with you in the long run. But I only say
again, be patient until seventy times seven, there&rsquo;s a good
man, for that&rsquo;s all you can do about it at present.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I will then,&rdquo; he promised, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;ll leave it at
that. And if you&rsquo;ll take your chance to talk sense to her,
I&rsquo;ll be a good bit obliged.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The rain had ceased, and Lydia went out for a breath of
air, while Ned lighted his pipe and accompanied her. A
good few of the workers were at hand, and Mr. Knox, seeing
Mrs. Trivett and her son-in-law, joined them. Kellock
passed, but did not stop, and Philander Knox praised
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, there&rsquo;s a chap that&rsquo;ll go far&mdash;either here or
somewhere else,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Most of you Devon people
I&rsquo;ve yet met with are pretty easy-going, like myself; but
that man is not. He&rsquo;s more than a paper maker. Dingle
here, and Life, and old Pinhey, the finisher, and Trood are
content to go on their way, and leave other people to do
the same. Kellock is not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got ideas,&rdquo; said Lydia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has. I&rsquo;ve took a room in the same house where he
lodges, and I&rsquo;ve heard him air his notions. They&rsquo;re commonplace
talk where I come from, but a bit ahead of the
times in the West Country. We middle-aged folk ain&rsquo;t
interested in &rsquo;em, but the rising generation is. He told
me straight out that we ought to have shop stewards in the
Mill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said Dingle. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want nothing of
that here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A burning mind for the rights of labour,&rdquo; continued
Knox, &ldquo;and though you may think we don&rsquo;t want shop
stewards, and I may think so, and the boss may think so,
shop stewards are a sign of the times, and they&rsquo;ll come
everywhere before long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope not,&rdquo; said Lydia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And shop stewardesses,&rdquo; added Philander; &ldquo;and if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
that happened, you&rsquo;d have to rise to it, Mrs. Trivett, for
the good of the young women.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lydia laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They might be wanted in some places&mdash;not here,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;We all work very comfortably and steady, and
there&rsquo;s none discontented in my department, that I know
about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just because you&rsquo;re the head of it and are a very
clever and human sort of woman,&rdquo; answered Mr. Knox.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got the touch, and you understand the nature of
the female and how to keep her in a good temper, and how
to get a fair day&rsquo;s work for a good day&rsquo;s wages.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ned left them at this juncture, and Mr. Knox proceeded.
Much to her surprise he praised Mrs. Trivett in
good set terms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t often I hear my
virtues mentioned, and I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ve named a good few
I can&rsquo;t lay claim to. Women&rsquo;s only a greater puzzle than
men, in my experience, and I don&rsquo;t pretend that I know
half that goes to either sort.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Character is a great mystery,&rdquo; he added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So it is then, and I don&rsquo;t want to look farther than at
home to know it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Trivett was speaking to herself rather than Philander
in this speech; she did not design any confession, but he
appeared to guess what was in her mind. Indeed, he did,
for he had seen her in company with Dingle, which was an
unusual incident at the Mill, and he heard much of the
rumour that Ned and his wife were out. He had also
heard of the blue mark on Medora&rsquo;s arm, from Mr. Pinhey,
whose operations as finisher took place in the glazing
room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if there&rsquo;s a blue mark on her arm, who knows what
marks there may be hidden elsewhere?&rdquo; murmured Mr.
Pinhey, with horrified eyes, behind his spectacles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As a man once married, though without a family, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
can understand that,&rdquo; answered Knox to Lydia. &ldquo;And if
I may say so, I venture respectfully to sympathise with
what&rsquo;s in your mind. I&rsquo;ve heard about Mrs. Dingle, and
nothing but kindness, for I&rsquo;m sure everybody likes her,
though not as well as they like you. And if it&rsquo;s not pushing
in, which is the last thing I would do, I should be
interested to know if, between Kellock and her husband,
she took the right one in your opinion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Trivett felt some concern that a newcomer should
have learned so much of the family history. But he spoke
with such propriety that she could not be annoyed. She
liked Mr. Knox, and found him, as everybody else did, a
good-natured and amiable person. It was true that Mr.
Trood had said that Knox was &ldquo;downy,&rdquo; but his downiness
had not yet appeared to simpler eyes.</p>

<p>She parried his question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know them both&mdash;what do you think?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know them, but I can&rsquo;t say I know her,&rdquo; he answered.
&ldquo;However, I know her mother, if I may say so,
without offence, and if Mrs. Dingle favours you, then I&rsquo;d
say without hesitation that she chose the right party.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s like me and not like me,&rdquo; explained Lydia. &ldquo;I
was pretty near what she is at her age.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better looking, I expect,&rdquo; he interrupted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, nothing like so fine&mdash;just a little go-by-the-ground
woman, same as I am now. But in character, not
unlike her. And if I&rsquo;d had so good a time as she has had,
no doubt I should have made the same mistakes and not
known reality better than her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can have too much reality,&rdquo; declared Philander.
&ldquo;Most of us poor people have such a deuce of a lot of
reality that we get tired of it. There&rsquo;s thousands for that
matter that never have anything else; and reality ain&rsquo;t
fattening if you belong to the labouring classes. But if
she&rsquo;d took Jordan Kellock, then she&rsquo;d have known what
reality was, and very likely gone down under it, like a mole
under a cart wheel. He&rsquo;s a wonderful good, earnest man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>&mdash;worth
all the rest of us put together, I dare say; but as
a husband for a young, pretty, laughter-loving woman&mdash;no.
He ain&rsquo;t built that way, and if your Medora finds
that Dingle isn&rsquo;t all she dreamed&mdash;as what man is after
the gilt&rsquo;s off the gingerbread?&mdash;then let her be sure she&rsquo;d
have done still worse along with Kellock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Trivett was moved, and nodded vigorously.
&ldquo;Very good sense, and you echo me,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
thought much the same. You&rsquo;re an understanding man,
and kind-hearted seemingly, and have been married yourself,
so you see things in a large spirit. I think my girl
took the right one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then she did, for you&rsquo;d make no mistake,&rdquo; declared
Knox. &ldquo;And if the right one, then we can trust time to
prove it. I&rsquo;m a great believer in the marriage state myself.
It&rsquo;s a power for good most times, and so I hope you
found it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Mrs. Trivett was not prepared for any further
confidences on this occasion. She did not answer his question,
though she expressed herself a believer in marriage.</p>

<small>ASSAULT AND BATTERY</small></h2></div>


<p>In the engine house a small, hump-backed man sat picking
over the masses of wet rag brought to him by Henry Barefoot
from the boilers. For, despite the sorters and the
magnet, enemies to paper still lurked in the sodden rag,
and the little man ran the sloppy stuff through his fingers,
extracting from time to time fragments of rubber, whalebone,
pearl, and other substances.</p>

<p>The engine house was a lofty chamber on two floors,
with windows that faced the west. Here, Ned Dingle
reigned, and half a dozen men worked under him. Much
happened to the rag before it came to Ned, for after its
final picking, it was washed again, and broken before the
beater turned it into pulp. When the little hump-backed
man had passed it, the rag was set revolving with water
in oval, lead-lined breakers. On one side the washer, like
a steamer&rsquo;s paddle-wheel, churned in a bladed barrel, so
that the rag was not only cleaned again, but also torn to
the smallest fragments; on the other side a drum of brass
wire sucked away the dirty water, while from the upper
end clean water was perpetually spurting in. Round and
round the rag revolved for three hours, by which time its
character had changed entirely. It was, in fact, rag no
more, but a substance like curds: &ldquo;half stuff,&rdquo; or rag
transformed and half-way to its final stages.</p>

<p>From the breakers the pulpy mass left the engine house
for a time, and sojourned in the bleaching tanks beneath.
It flowed down through pipes to a subterranean chamber,
where the air was sharp with the smell of chemicals, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
twelve great, gaping wells ranged round a narrow passage
way. Here came the &ldquo;half stuff&rdquo; to repose on beds of
Delabole slate, and endure the operations of the bleach for
half a day or more. Then the liquid was drained off, the
snow-white, solid masses forked out on to little trolleys,
and so returned to Ned Dingle in the engine house. Again
it revolved until the bleach was thoroughly washed out of
it, for it is a principle of great paper making that the
less chemicals, the better the pulp; and now perfected,
washed, broken and bleached, the material came to the
beater for final dissection.</p>

<p>The beaters&rsquo; engines were oval in form and resembled
the breakers. They stood upon the lower floor of the
engine house, and each communicated directly with the
breaker above it, and the vat room far beneath. From
final washing, the pulp flowed directly to Mr. Dingle, and,
as before, revolved, and was churned by a paddle-wheel set
with fine knives. Ned controlled it, and on his judgment
depended the quality of the pulp that would presently flow
down to Kellock, Knox, and the other vatmen.</p>

<p>He was explaining the process to a young man, who had
just been promoted to his assistant from the breakers
above.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s got to meet every test that experience can bring
against it, Jacob,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And if it did not, I should
mighty soon hear of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He regulated the churning wheel with a footplate, and
presently, satisfied that the mass, which was now like fine
cream after revolving in the beating tank for many hours,
had reached perfection, Ned took a test to satisfy himself.</p>

<p>Two hand-bowls, or dippers, he lifted, scooped up a few
ounces of the pulp, then mixed it with pure water, and
flung the liquid backwards from one dipper to the other,
pouring off and adding fresh water until what was left in
his bowl resembled water barely stained with soap. The
pulp was now so diluted that it needed sharp eyes to see
anything in the water at all; but Dingle, taking it to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
window, set it slowly dribbling away over the edge of the
bowl, and as it flowed, the liquid revealed tiny fragments
and filaments all separate, and as fine as spider&rsquo;s thread.
The spectacle of these attenuated fibres of cotton told the
beaterman that his engine was ready and the pulp sufficiently
fine. The masses of rag, once linen and lace, and
every sort of textile fabric woven of cotton, had become
reduced to its limit of tenuity, and was now far finer stuff
than in the cotton pod of its creation. It had been beaten
into countless millions of fibrils, long and short, and all so
fine as to need sharpest scrutiny of human eye to distinguish
them.</p>

<p>Jacob&mdash;a future beaterman&mdash;followed Ned&rsquo;s operations
closely; then he made a test himself and watched the
cotton gossamer flow over the edge of his bowl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And next week,&rdquo; declared Ned, &ldquo;something finer still
has got to be made&mdash;so fine that I shall have to borrow
a pair of spectacles to see it&mdash;good as my eyes are. And
that&rsquo;s the pulp for the Exhibition moulds. It&rsquo;s to be a
record&mdash;such paper as never before was made in the
world. But this is just ordinary, first class rag pulp&mdash;stuff
that will last till doomsday if properly handled.
Now it&rsquo;s going down to Knox&rsquo;s vat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He sent a boy to the vat room to warn Philander that a
re-inforcement was about to descend. Then he sought a
square shaft in the corner of the engine house, took off the
lid and revealed an empty, lead-lined box, having six holes
at the bottom. Each was securely stopped and all communicated
with the great chests that held the pulp for the
paper makers below.</p>

<p>He opened one hole, drew a valve from the beating engine
and allowed it slowly to empty into the box. The
white mass sank away out of it; there was a gurgle and a
splash of air from the valve as the engine emptied; while
with a wooden rake Ned scraped the last of the pulp to
the aperture, whence it ran to the box above the chests in
the vat room.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>&ldquo;No. 4 chest is being filled, so it&rsquo;s No. 4 hole I&rsquo;ve opened
in the box,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;Now it&rsquo;s all run down very
quick you see, and my beater is empty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the breaker above disgorged another load of  &ldquo;half
stuff&rdquo; into the beater, and after he had used a beating
roll, he set the paddle-wheel going again and the new consignment
revolved on its way.</p>

<p>Ned took a keen interest in his work and though he
might be casual and easy-going in all other affairs of life,
it was clear that he could be serious enough over the operations
of the beater. He was very thorough and never left
anything to chance. Opportunity for initiative did not
enter into his labours; but the hard and fast lines of perfection
he followed with keen application, and it was his
fair boast that he had never sent bad pulp to the vatmen.
Though a mechanical calling, Ned did not approach it in
a mechanical spirit. It was his particular gift and privilege
to feel a measure of enthusiasm in the craft, and he
prided himself upon his skill.</p>

<p>Novelty now awaited him, for the pulp presently to be
made would differ in quality from the familiar material.
The beating it to an impalpable fineness would be his work.
The pulp was also to be dyed with new tinctures, not used
until now.</p>

<p>For not only snowwhite material descended to the vat
room. The dyeing was a part of Mr. Dingle&rsquo;s operation
in many cases, and the various colours of foreign currency
papers went into the stuff during its sojourn in the beaters.</p>

<p>Dingle, satisfied with his pupil, put on his coat when the
dinner bell rang, the steam pulses of the works subsided
and the power stopped. He took his basket and descended
a long flight of steps to the vat room, where Kellock, Life
and the other paper makers had just knocked off work.
Others joined them, for the vast and airy vat room was a
favourite place for dinner; but Medora did not come.
For several weeks now she had ceased to meet Ned at the
hour of the mid-day meal. The fact was, of course, noted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
and debated behind Dingle&rsquo;s back; but none spoke of it in
front of him.</p>

<p>The change in Medora at this stage of her existence was
obvious enough to all; while that which marked her husband
did not appear so clearly. The reason had been easy
to see, though few knew enough about them to see it. Medora,
while really disingenuous, revealed her tribulation,
because she desired everybody to perceive it; while Ned,
naturally an open and simple creature, endeavoured with
the instinct of a decent male to hide his worries from the
public eye. He failed, however, because he was not built
to play a part, while Medora succeeded to perfection.
Thus she created an impression of secret woes that did not
really exist, while Ned attempted to conceal anxieties which
were real enough. His temper suffered under a strain that
he was not created to endure, for his wife&rsquo;s attitude, having
first puzzled him, began to anger him. He lost his
temper with her on certain occasions and her sublime patience
under his rough tongue by no means turned his
wrath from her. For nothing is more maddening, if you
are the smiter, than to have the other cheek turned to you
by a sufferer, who displays obvious gusto at your chastisement.
Ned soon saw that Medora liked him to be violent
and brutal. It was meat and drink to her to see him in a
rage. He guessed, and not wrongly, that if he had beaten
her, she must have relished the pain&mdash;not for itself, but
for the exquisite pleasure of relating her sufferings to other
people afterwards.</p>

<p>She was changed, as any woman is who for pleasure or
profit plays a part. Indeed many persist in such histrionics
when profit has long ceased, for simple artistic delight
at the impersonation. It is natural to prefer a rle
which we can perform to perfection, before others wherein
we are not so effective.</p>

<p>The suffering and wronged and ill-treated heroine
proved an impersonation that suited Medora&rsquo;s temperament
exactly, and having once assumed it, she promised to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
persist in it beyond the limits of her husband&rsquo;s patience.
She would doubtless tire sooner or later, since it is the
instinct of every actor to desire new parts and new successes;
but she was not going to tire of it while she made
such a hit, won so much attention and created such a dramatic
and exciting atmosphere about her. In fact Medora
now felt herself to be the centre of her own little stage,
and the experience so much delighted her that it was difficult
sometimes to retain the air of crushed, Christian
resignation proper to the character.</p>

<p>But the situation she had created out of nothing real,
now developed and began to take unto itself dangerous elements
of reality. Such theatricals do not stand still, and
instead of subsiding, as Lydia hoped it would, Mrs. Dingle&rsquo;s
objections and grievances, woven of gossamer at first,
began to grow tougher. She guessed that she would catch
more than herself in these elaborate reticulations, and she
persisted until she found another was becoming entangled
also.</p>

<p>At first, to do her justice, Medora hesitated here. But
she could not pour her woes into Kellock&rsquo;s ears without a
reaction from him, and his attitude towards her confession
naturally influenced her. For, while some of her elders
suspected, according to the measure of their wits, that Medora
was acting, one man saw no shadow of deception.
Every word rang true on his ear, for circumstances combined
hopelessly to hoodwink him. His own serious nature,
from which any powers of illusion or sleight were excluded,
read nothing but the face value into Medora&rsquo;s woeful
countenance and the word value into her hopeless
speeches. Not for him to answer mock heroics with banter,
or reply to burlesque with irony. Had he been made
of different stuff, he might have saved Medora from herself
at this season; but being himself, the admirable man was
terribly perturbed and indeed found himself beset with sore
questions and problems from which both his character and
personal attitude to the girl precluded escape. For he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
loved her, and the fact that she was an unhappy woman did
not lessen his love; while, beyond that, his altruistic instincts
must have brought him into a delicate complication
in any case when once invited to participate. And now he
did enter, with motives that could not honestly be considered
mixed, for he was thus far influenced only by a conviction
that it might be possible to help both sufferers to a
better understanding. He knew that he enjoyed a far
larger measure of intellect than Ned, and he felt that to
shirk an effort for Medora&rsquo;s sake would be cowardly. He
had indeed convinced himself that it was his duty to act.</p>

<p>He proceeded to tackle Ned, but he approached the task
without the attitude of mind vital to success. For success
in such a ticklish matter demanded in Kellock a standpoint
of absolute impartiality. He must, if he were to do
any good whatever, come to Dingle with a mind as open
and unprejudiced as possible; whereas, though he knew it
not, Jordan&rsquo;s mind by no means stood in that relation to
the pair. Had it done so, he had probably not interfered;
for in truth it could not be altruism alone that prompted
him to the step he was now about to take, but a very active
and sincere sympathy for Medora in her alleged griefs.
He believed her with all his heart and he had a great deal
more concern for Mrs. Dingle&rsquo;s point of view, which he accepted,
than for her husband&rsquo;s, which he had neither heard
nor considered.</p>

<p>The men had eaten their dinner, and Ned, out of a cheerful
demeanour, which he brought from his work, presently
sank into taciturnity. From no will to do so, but powerlessness
to prevent it, he showed those about him that his
thoughts were not pleasant. Indeed the most casual had
noticed that he was of late only himself in the engine house,
and that nothing but work sufficed to take him out of himself.
Away from it, he brooded and did not chatter and
jest as of old.</p>

<p>To-day he was more than usually abstracted and Kellock
seized the opportunity. Ned&rsquo;s meal was finished in ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
minutes and when he began to stuff his pipe, the other
asked him to come for a stroll up the valley.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go up to the ponds and see if there are any birds
about, Ned,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>A little surprised, since the bird that interested Kellock
was unknown, Ned nevertheless agreed to take a walk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Me and Trood flushed a
woodcock there yesterday, and I dare say on Saturday
Trood will bring him down. He&rsquo;s a mark on a woodcock&mdash;never
misses &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They strolled together up the valley where it fell gently
to the Mill.</p>

<p>A quarter of a mile above the works the coomb narrowed
to a bottle-neck, through which a water-fall came down.
The road wound through this gap and on one side of it
rose old, blue limestone quarries, their jagged scarps and
ridges fledged with gorse and oak scrub; while on the other
side of the water a limestone bluff ascended, weathered to
fine colour, and above it towered Scotch firs and ivy-clad
beeches that followed the foot of the hill and flung their
arms around a little mere, lying in the hollow of the undulating
land.</p>

<p>In spring this cup shone emerald green; but now the
place was grey and silver. Alders and sallows towered
black against the bright water; sedges and reed mace had
huddled into tangle of russet and amber. They brightened
where the sun touched them and burned over the
placid lake, while the highest colour note was a spindle
tree, whereon hung its harvest of pink and orange fruit,
though all the leaves were fled. The flame of it cast a brilliant
reflection into the face of the mirror below; and as
Ned and Jordan approached by a winding way, that
skirted the mere, coot and moorhen scuttled off leaving
double trains behind them, widening out upon the waters.</p>

<p>Here it was that Kellock broached the great matter at
his heart; and because it was at his heart, whereas he
imagined it solely in his head, he found within the space<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
of two minutes that he had made a very grievous mistake.</p>

<p>Beside the lake spoke Jordan, while Ned had his eyes in
the sedges and distant mud flats for a woodcock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about your wife I wanted to say a word, and I
know we&rsquo;re too good friends for you to object. You see,
Ned, when you look at the past&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To hell with the past,&rdquo; answered Dingle shortly.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the future I look at. You take my tip and keep
out of this&mdash;specially seeing you wanted her yourself
once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must speak,&rdquo; answered the vatman mildly, &ldquo;and
just for that reason, Ned. When she took you, you&rsquo;ll remember
I followed a very self-respecting line about it.
But at your wish&mdash;at your wish, Ned&mdash;I kept my friendship
for Medora and you; and it&rsquo;s out of that friendship
I want to say I think things might be bettered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s been washing our dirty linen for your pleasure
then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all. But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;God damn it!&rdquo; burst out the other. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t there to
be any peace left in the world? You get out of this and
keep out of it, or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly, Ned,&mdash;listen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To you? Not much. There&rsquo;s some hooken-snivey
going on here by the looks of it. Blast you&mdash;there&mdash;that&rsquo;s
my answer to you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dingle, in a white-hot passion, swung his arm, hit Kellock
on the side of his head with a tremendous blow and
knocked him down. They were on the edge of the lake and
Medora&rsquo;s champion rolled over and fell into water ten
feet deep. He was stunned and sank, then came to the
surface again.</p>

<p>Ned&rsquo;s rage vanished with the blow, for now he saw in a
moment the gravity of the situation. Kellock appeared
to be unconscious and would certainly drown if left in the
water.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>The man on the bank flung himself upon his stomach,
leant over, gripped his victim by the collar and dragged
him breast high under the bank. In this position Kellock
came at once to his senses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&mdash;I&rsquo;m cruel sorry,&rdquo; said Dingle. &ldquo;Lift
up your hands and put &rsquo;em round my neck&mdash;then I&rsquo;ll
heave you out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kellock opened his eyes and panted, but did nothing for
a moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake make an effort&mdash;I can&rsquo;t help you else.
Get your arms round my neck, Jordan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other obeyed and in a few moments he was safe.
Ned fished his cap out of the water, wrung it and handed
it to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m bitter sorry&mdash;my cursed temper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kellock sat down for a moment and pressed the water
out of his clothes. He was quite calm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dare say it was natural,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;d
but listened&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t listen to things if you&rsquo;re in hell. Take my
arm. No good biding here. I&rsquo;ll see you to your house.
You can have the law of me. I deserve it. I&rsquo;m no bloody
good to anybody in the world now-a-days. Better I was
locked up, I reckon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk rot. We&rsquo;re all learners. You&rsquo;ve learned
me something anyway. See me home. I&rsquo;m dazed, but I
shall be all right in a minute. And don&rsquo;t let on about
this. I shall say I slipped on the edge of the water and
fell in and bruised my head&mdash;just an accident and my
fault. And so it was my fault.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t have that. You rub it in. I&rsquo;ve earned it. I
shall tell the people what I am, if you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; answered the other. &ldquo;Think of me
as well as yourself in that matter. You&rsquo;re popular; I&rsquo;m
not; and if they hear you&rsquo;ve knocked me into the water,
they&rsquo;ll say there was a reason for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dingle did not answer, but he knew this to be true.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>&ldquo;Least said soonest mended then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For your wife&rsquo;s sake, Ned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leave her out, please. I&rsquo;m in your debt and I shan&rsquo;t
forget it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They met some women returning to the works and lied
to them. All expressed great concern. Then Ned
brought Kellock to his rooms and begged him to drink
some spirits which he refused to do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mind we tell the same tale about this,&rdquo; said Jordan.
&ldquo;I fell in and you grabbed me from the bank and brought
me ashore. After all it&rsquo;s the truth, so far as it goes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dingle agreed and then returned to his work; while the
injured man, though in considerable pain, only waited to
change his clothes and then hastened back to the Mill, to
explain his accident and be chaffed for his carelessness.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br />


<small>THE OLD PRIORY</small></h2></div>


<p>There was none to drag up the melancholy blossoms of
Medora&rsquo;s woe and display the fact that they had no roots;
but she kept them alive nevertheless; and since she was
tickled to persist in folly by the increasing interest created
from her alleged sufferings, she woke up to find those sufferings
real at last. She had now earned a great deal of
pity and won a reputation for patience and endurance.
She had also awakened a certain measure of feeling against
Ned, which was inevitable, and now conditions which she
had implied, knowing at the bottom of her heart they did
not exist, began to develop in reality. The man was not
built to watch Medora&rsquo;s histrionics in patience for ever,
and she found him growing harsh and rough.</p>

<p>Then there was no more play-acting for Medora. Outraged
in every instinct, her sense of humour dead and her
self-consciousness morbidly hypertrophied, she began to
hate the man she had married. The cause of his changed
attitude she forgot; and the bad usage for which she had
deliberately played, when it came she resented with all her
soul. Now she ceased to be a wife to him and daily threatened
to leave him.</p>

<p>A series of incidents more or less painful led to the
threshold of complete estrangement and Medora was always
ahead of her husband and always a good stage farther
advanced to the final rupture than was he. Indeed
he never knew until the climax burst upon him that it was
so near. He did wrong things at this season, was hard
when he should have been gentle, and allowed himself brutalities
of speech and action. But again and again after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
such ebullitions, he was contrite, abased himself and implored
Medora to help him to a better comradeship and
understanding.</p>

<p>Each sought to confide, and Ned confided in Medora
herself, while she went elsewhere. Her interest was rapidly
shifting and her husband&rsquo;s efforts at reconciliation
meant nothing now. For the time being she heartily
loathed him, and the sound of his voice in the house, and
the fall of his foot. Yet between his furies he had struggled
hard to restore their friendship. He had confessed
the incident with Kellock and described to Medora how, in
his passion that anybody should presume to come between
them, even with good advice, he had turned on the vatman,
knocked him into the water and then pulled him out again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He meant well; but it shows what a state I&rsquo;m in that I
could do it. He forgave me quickly enough, but I couldn&rsquo;t
forgive myself. And I only tell you, Medora, to show
what a perilous and unnatural frame of mind I&rsquo;ve got to.
It&rsquo;s all so properly cruel&mdash;as if some unseen devil had
poked his claws into our affairs and was trying to tear &rsquo;em
apart. And God knows I&rsquo;ll do any mortal thing that man
can do to right it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was, however, much more interested in the disaster
to Kellock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did he say that made you try to murder him?&rdquo;
she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t try to murder him&mdash;I only shut his mouth.
So I don&rsquo;t know what he was going to say. He admitted
I was right anyway, and that it was not his place to interfere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nobody&rsquo;s got the right to talk sense to you seemingly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not telling you this for you to begin on me again,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m telling you to show you what you&rsquo;re doing
and what you&rsquo;ve done to my temper. If anybody had told
me a year ago I&rsquo;d forget myself and knock a man down
for trying to do me a good turn, I&rsquo;d never have believed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
it. Yet such is my state that I did so. And since then
I&rsquo;ve asked Jordan to speak about the thing and give me
any advice he could; but he&rsquo;s told me frankly the time has
passed for that. He won&rsquo;t speak now. He forgave me
for knocking him into the water; but I can see with half an
eye he don&rsquo;t want any more to do with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Medora, well knowing why this was, yet pretended not
to know.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must ask yourself for a reason then and no doubt
your conscience will find it, Ned. We must cut a loss before
long&mdash;you and me&mdash;for I don&rsquo;t want to die under
this. I can&rsquo;t stand very much more and I dare say you
feel the same.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;you mean by &lsquo;cut a loss&rsquo;?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>But after any pregnant remark of this description, Medora
temporised for a time and preferred to be indefinite.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I mean,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
times when I wish I was out of it, young as I am. I can
suffer and suffer of course. I&rsquo;m strong and there&rsquo;s no
limit to my endurance. But I&rsquo;m beginning to ask myself
&lsquo;why?&rsquo; And for that matter there are one or two others
asking me the same question.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The woman&rsquo;s always right if
her face is pretty enough. You&rsquo;ve got the art always to
be in the right, and there&rsquo;s only one on God&rsquo;s earth, and
that&rsquo;s me, who knows you&rsquo;re wickedly in the wrong quite
as often as I am. It&rsquo;s your wrongs in other people&rsquo;s
mouths that made me do wrong; and when you saw me setting
out with all my heart to be patient and win you back
again, you set yourself wickedly to work to break down
my patience and egg me on. Again and again you&rsquo;ve kept
at me till I&rsquo;ve gone too far and done evil; and then you&rsquo;ve
run about everywhere and let everybody know what a
coward and brute I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way you talk,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I can only
listen with my heart broken. You say these things for no
reason but to make me angry, and as to patience, even you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
will grant, if there&rsquo;s any justice left in you, that my patience
has never broke down from the first. And when
the people have talked, I&rsquo;ve laughed it off and put a bright
face on it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know that bright face&mdash;as though you were
saying, &lsquo;you see I&rsquo;m an angel already and only want the
wings.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, your tongue!&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;To think that
ever you could scourge a good wife with such bitter, biting
words.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then she wept and he cursed and went out. It was a
scene typical of others; but from the moment that Medora
heard of Kellock&rsquo;s immersion she could not rest until she
had let him know she knew it. They were meeting now unknown
to Dingle, for though Jordan at first protested
against any private conference, Medora quickly over-ruled
him. For a month she had made it clear that only the
wisdom of Mr. Kellock was keeping her sane; and he believed
it. Nor was this altogether untrue, for Medora,
now genuinely miserable, began to seek increasing sustenance
and support from her old lover.</p>

<p>As in the case of all her other schemes for entertainment
and exaltation, she crept to this and let it develop slowly.
As the rift between her and Ned grew wider, the gap narrowed
between her and Jordan Kellock. At each meeting
she decreased the distance between them, yet never by definite
word or deed appeared to be doing so. Kellock himself
did not realise it. He knew the fact and taxed his own
conscience with it at first; but then for a time his conscience
left him in doubt as to his duty, until in the light
of Medora&rsquo;s increasing sufferings, it spoke more distinctly
and chimed dangerously with his inclination.</p>

<p>His whole life was dominated by this great matter. It
had become personal and he wrestled with his difficulties by
day and night. Medora was one of those women who have
a marvellous power of influencing other judgments. She
had a fatal gift to waken dislike and distrust of another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
person in the mind of a third. She had already created
aversion for Ned in the minds of several women; now Jordan,
despite his own reason, felt himself beginning to hate
Dingle as heartily as Medora appeared to do. He fought
this emotion for a time; but found it impossible any longer
to maintain an impartial attitude. He told himself that
it was only false sentiment to pretend farther impartiality.
Justice demanded antagonism to Ned in the future&mdash;not
because Medora had once been Jordan&rsquo;s whole hope
and desire and was now herself unhappy and friendless;
but because, as an honest man, Kellock could not longer
be impartial.</p>

<p>His views of life were changing; his orderly mind was
beginning to suspect that strong action might be necessary.
Justice was the word most often on his lips; and yet
knowing that he loved Medora, he was intelligent enough
to perceive that inclination might be deluding him and
making apparently simple what, in reality, was complex.
For a time he hesitated; then came a day when he met
Medora by appointment and felt it impossible to stand
outside her life any longer. She, indeed, forced his hand
and made it clear that she was going to take definite steps
for her own salvation.</p>

<p>Medora, on her way to Priory Farm one Sunday afternoon,
had arranged to meet Kellock at the ruins of the
building that gave the farm its name. Here they would be
safe from any interruption.</p>

<p>The fragment of masonry crowned Mr. Dolbear&rsquo;s orchard
on the summit of the hill that fell into Cornworthy.
Here, heaved up against the sky in its ivy mantle, stood
the meagre remains of an old priory, one of the smaller
houses of the Austin nuns, founded by the Norman lords of
Totnes.</p>

<p>It consisted of a great gateway with a roof vaulted,
ribbed and bossed, and a lesser entrance that stood to the
north of the first. They pierced the mass and bore above
them a chamber, of which only the floor and ruined walls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
remained. It was reached by a stair, where stone steps
wound in the thickness of the wall and opened on to the
crown of the ruin fifty feet above. The space aloft was
hung with polypody and spleenwort in the chinks of its
crumbling mortar, and ivy knots seemed to hold the mass
together. A whitethorn had found foothold and rose
above the central block of stone. Through a ruined aperture
facing east, one might see the orchard sloping to the
valley bottom and Cornworthy&rsquo;s scattered dwellings, ascending
on the farther hill. The picture, set in the grey
granite frame of the priory window, revealed thatched
houses grouped closely, with land sweeping upwards on
either side, so that the hamlet lay in a dingle between the
breasts of the red earth. The land climbed on beyond the
village and threw a hogged back across the sky. Here
were broad fallows and hedgerows where the leafless elms
broke the line with their grey skeletons. To this exalted
but secret place, Medora and Kellock were come. He had
indeed been there some time when she arrived.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you sit here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re out of the wind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re safe now,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;And &rsquo;twas like you
to put yourself about and tramp all this way. But I&rsquo;ve
got to be terrible careful, Jordan, for if my husband
thought I&rsquo;d any friends working for me and thinking for
me, I don&rsquo;t know what awful thing he&rsquo;d do against me.
Nuns used to live here in past ages,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;Oh,
my God! I wish I&rsquo;d been one of them. Then I should have
spent my days in peace and be at rest now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sit down and let&rsquo;s use our time as best we can,&rdquo; he
advised.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Time&mdash;time&mdash;I want for time to end. For two pins
I&rsquo;d jump out of that window and end all time so far as I&rsquo;m
concerned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t talk or think like that, or else I shall fear
I can&rsquo;t be any use. I tell you, before God, that my life&rsquo;s
all centred in you and your troubles now. I shan&rsquo;t have
no peace till you have peace.&rdquo;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll live for you then; and that&rsquo;s about all I want to
live for any longer,&rdquo; declared Medora. She felt in a theatrical
mood and Ned&rsquo;s recent confession enabled her to
speak with a great oncoming of warmth and emotion.
Her perception had fastened upon it from the first and
measured its value.</p>

<p>And now in the Priory ruin, she made the most of the
matter. She had worked it up and found it a tower of
strength.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know what happened,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You hid it, Jordan,
like the man you are; but he told me how he knocked
you into the water&mdash;cruel devil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry he told you.&mdash;I asked him not to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He wanted me to see what he could do, and would do
again, and will do again. He properly hates me now, and
I shall soon be going in fear of my life&mdash;I know that well
enough. Not that I care much for my life; but it&rsquo;s awful
to live with a tiger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean that, Medora?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do then. He&rsquo;s far ways different from what he
was, or what anybody thinks. He may pretend in the
works; but he&rsquo;s got the temper of a devil; and sometimes
I wish he&rsquo;d strike and finish me; and sometimes&mdash;I&rsquo;m
young and I don&rsquo;t like to think of dying&mdash;sometimes I
say to myself I&rsquo;ll make a bolt for it and go out into the
world and chance it. The world would be kinder than him
and anyway it couldn&rsquo;t be crueller.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is fearful&mdash;fearful,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
stand you saying these things, Medora.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t if they weren&rsquo;t true. It can&rsquo;t go on. I
hate to distress you, but there&rsquo;s not a soul in the world
cares a button what becomes of me but you. I&rsquo;m punished
for the past I suppose. I deserve it. I took that cruel
tyrant when I might have took you&mdash;there, don&rsquo;t listen
to me. I&rsquo;m mad to-day.&rdquo; She worked herself into tears
and wept convulsively, while he stared helplessly out at the
world. His mind moved. He could not stand her con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>tinued
suffering, and the confession and assurance of danger
inspired him to thoughts of action. Something must
be done. She was in evident peril now. Any day might
bring the awful news of a disaster beyond repair. Such
things were in every newspaper. Not for an instant did
he doubt the critical nature of the situation. He hated to
think Medora must presently return home to sleep under
the same roof as her husband. To his order of mind the
situation appealed with the uttermost gravity, for not an
inkling of the true Medora tinctured his impression and he
was as ignorant of the true Ned. He trusted the woman
absolutely and he loved her. He steadfastly believed now
that the most precious life in the world to him was in torment
and in danger. She had, under dreadful stress of
emotion as it appeared, more than once expressed her regret
at the fatal step in the past. She had mourned
frankly and explicitly at taking Dingle, when she might
have married Kellock himself.</p>

<p>Here then was the tremendous problem for him; and so
pressing and immediate did it appear, that the young man
was driven out of his usual level attitude of mind and customary
deliberation before the demands of life. For the
moment his future ambitions and purposes were lost: he
was only urged by the instant necessity to decide what
might best be done for Medora&rsquo;s sake. Immense prospects
opened before him&mdash;knightly deeds, and unconventional
achievements calling for great efforts and an indifference
to all commonplace, social standards.</p>

<p>He was prepared at a future time to make war upon
society for the sake of his class, if the occasion demanded
it. He fully intended presently to stand forth with the
protagonists of labour and fight for socialism. He anticipated
that battle and was educating and priming himself
for it. As yet the great revolt belonged to the future and
there his ultimate ambition lay; but now an immediate personal
appeal confronted him&mdash;a matter in which he himself
and his own happiness were deeply involved. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
more than himself, for he felt that Medora&rsquo;s future now
hung in the balance. Her destiny waited on him.</p>

<p>But he did not tell Medora the result of his reflections.
For the moment he bade her be of good cheer and trust him.</p>

<p>While she sobbed, he considered and then, feeling it was
time to speak, comforted her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;ve told me all this,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It shows
you know where you can put your faith. And since you
come to me with it, Medora, I&rsquo;ll make it my business. I&rsquo;m
only a human man and I loved you with all my heart, and
I do love you with all my heart still, and now the case is
altered. I should never have thought of you again&mdash;not
in that way&mdash;if your married life had turned out all
right; but as it&rsquo;s turned out all wrong, then it&rsquo;s up to me
to come into your life again. May I do so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the only thing in my life,&rdquo; she said, drying her
eyes. &ldquo;Everything else makes me want to end it&mdash;yes,
I&rsquo;ve thought often of that, Jordan. But I&rsquo;ll thankfully
put myself in your hands and be patient a bit longer if you
tell me to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t a case for waiting,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a case for
doing. I don&rsquo;t know what fear is myself, and more did
you till he made you. It looks very much to me as if you&rsquo;d
have to come to me, Medora.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, my God&mdash;could you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I could, and I will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Think of yourself&mdash;it&rsquo;s like your bravery to put me
first and I&rsquo;d be your slave and live for you and thank
Heaven for its blessings; but I don&rsquo;t want to ruin your life,
you good, brave man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nobody can ruin your life but yourself,&rdquo; he answered,
&ldquo;and if I save your life, it won&rsquo;t be to ruin my own. Say
you&rsquo;d like it to be so and leave the rest to me. I mean it,
Medora.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A dream that had often filled the girl&rsquo;s waking thoughts
suddenly promised to come true and for a moment she was
frightened. But only for a moment. She hardly hesi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>tated.
Here was romance, fame, the centre of the stage&mdash;everything.
She knew very well that she could trust him,
and if ever she loved and adored the impassive vatman it
was at this moment.</p>

<p>She took his hand and pressed her lips to it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like it!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;It would be heaven on earth&mdash;heaven
on earth. And God&rsquo;s my judge you shan&rsquo;t repent
it. I&rsquo;ll live for you and die for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So be it, Medora. It&rsquo;s done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He put his arms round her and kissed her. Then both
felt a secret desire to be alone and consider the magnitude
of the decision. He voiced this wish.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll part now,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You go down to your
mother and I&rsquo;ll go home. Be quite easy in your mind and
cheerful and content. Leave the rest to me. I&rsquo;ll write to
you to-night after I&rsquo;ve gone all through it. It ain&rsquo;t so
difficult as it sounds if we back each other up properly.
I&rsquo;ll see you get the letter to-morrow out of sight of everybody
at the works. Be round by the vat house half after
eleven. You&rsquo;ve got a man to deal with&mdash;remember that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;God bless you,&rdquo; she answered very earnestly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
yours now, and never, never shall you repent of it, Jordan.
You can trust me same as I trust you in everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They descended the winding stair of the ruin and then
parted. Medora went down through the orchard to her
mother&rsquo;s home at Priory Farm, while Kellock, climbing
through the hedge, presently set his face to Dene and
strolled down the Corkscrew Lane with his mind full of the
future. He found that thought persisted in drifting away
from Medora to her husband. He had just told her that
she had a man to deal with; and now it was impressed on
Kellock that he, also, had to deal with a man.</p>

<p>Meantime Ned&rsquo;s wife reached the farm, and before she
did so, she bathed her eyes at a little stream under the
orchard hedge.</p>

<p>She appeared in an unusually contented frame of mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
and Lydia was glad to see her so. Another guest had arrived,
for Philander Knox, at Mrs. Trivett&rsquo;s invitation,
visited Priory Farm. A friendship had sprung up between
him and the widow, for modest though Lydia might be, she
could not fail to perceive her company was agreeable to
Mr. Knox. He would listen to her opinions in a flattering
manner and often expressed surprise to mark how her
sense chimed with his experience. His own philosophy
and general outlook on life were approved by Mrs. Trivett
and on this occasion she had invited him to drink tea at
Priory Farm and meet her brother and his family.</p>

<p>He had come and, as all who first penetrated into the
life of the farm, found himself bewildered by its complications.
The children, the mother, and the helpless father
appeared to revolve as a system of greater and lesser
planets around the steadfast sun of Lydia. She moved in
the chaos as though it were her proper environment&mdash;&ldquo;like
a ship in a storm,&rdquo; as Mr. Knox afterwards told her.</p>

<p>Philander had designed to enliven the tea with humorous
chatter. He wished to impress Mr. Dolbear and his wife
favourably, for he was a sociable person and anxious to
increase the number of friends in his new home; but he
found a meal at Priory Farm no occasion for much intercourse
or advancement of amenities. It proved a strenuous
and rather exasperating affair. The children dominated
the tea and the tea table. They chattered until they
had eaten all they could and departed; then, when the
visitor hoped that his opportunity had come, he found,
instead, that their mother took up the conversation and
discussed the vanished youngsters one by one. She lingered
over each as a gardener over his treasures, or a connoisseur
over his collection. They were an incomparable
group of children, it appeared; and what puzzled Philander
was to find that Lydia enjoyed the subject as much as
Mary herself. She also knew the children by heart and
was evidently devoted to each and all of them.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>Tom Dolbear said very little, but enjoyed listening.
His brood rejoiced him and he lived now in hope of another
boy.</p>

<p>It was Medora who strove to change the subject and
allow Bobby and Milly and Clara and Jenny and the rest
to drop out of the conversation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Knox will be sick to death of your babies, Aunt
Polly,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Far from it,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;A finer, hopefuller family
I never wish to see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Dolbear then invited Philander to come into the
garden and smoke, but finding the ladies were not prepared
to accompany them, he declined.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s all the same to you, I&rsquo;ll rest here until I must
get going,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not used to your hills yet
and they weary my legs a lot. Never a great walker&mdash;after
the way of town birds that have lived all their lives
by a tram line.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he sat and smoked, while Lydia cleared the tea things
and Medora helped her.</p>

<p>With Mrs. Trivett there were few opportunities for
speech. She came and went and worked. Then the dusk
fell and the younger Dolbears were brought in to go to
bed. Medora nursed the baby for a time and her mother
noticed that she was more than usually cheerful.</p>

<p>Knox then declared that he must be going home and
offered to escort Medora. She agreed and having thanked
Tom for his hospitality and hoped that he might be privileged
to accept it again at some future time, he took his
leave. On the way home he spoke to his companion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your mother&rsquo;s a wonderful woman, Mrs. Dingle,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;I see these things from the outside and I&rsquo;m properly
astonished at her cleverness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So she is,&rdquo; admitted Medora. &ldquo;But I wish she
wouldn&rsquo;t work so hard all the same. She does her day at
the Mill and then comes back home and instead of getting
her proper rest&mdash;well, you see what it is.&rdquo;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s like the mainspring of a watch,&rdquo; declared Philander.
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a most delicate contrivance, yet all depends
upon it; and if I may say so, as an outsider, you can see
with half an eye that her relations depend upon her for
everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They do&mdash;they do. If anything happened to
mother, I don&rsquo;t know what would become of Aunt and
Uncle&mdash;let alone all the children.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t know their luck,&rdquo; he said, and Medora
agreed with him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you see it. I&rsquo;ve often thought that&mdash;so
have other people. My mother at Priory Farm is like a
cheese-cake in a pigstye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Strong, but not too strong. She must have great
affection for them to stand it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Once a man offered for mother,&rdquo; said Medora; &ldquo;and,
at the first whisper of it, Uncle Tom and Aunt Polly pretty
well went on their knees to her not to leave them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can well believe it. It didn&rsquo;t come to anything,
however?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no&mdash;mother&rsquo;s not for another husband.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If anything might make her think upon such a change,
it would be that household surely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Medora. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just that helpless
household that would make her sacrifice herself. Duty&rsquo;s
her God. She&rsquo;s mother to all those children&mdash;more their
mother than Aunt Polly in a way&mdash;for my aunt is so
busy bringing them into the world, that she&rsquo;s got to leave
all the rest of the work to other people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Knox shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s contrary to nature that such a fine woman as Mrs.
Trivett should hide her light under that bushel,&rdquo; he asserted.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very selfish thing to let her slave and
wear her fingers to the bone like that; but it often happens
so. A husband and wife with a long family always seem
to fasten on some good-natured, kindly creature and drag
her in their house to be a slave to their children. There&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
no selfishness like the selfishness of a pair with a long quiver.
They&rsquo;ll fairly batter the life out of anybody who&rsquo;s fool
enough to lend a hand; and the more such a person does
for the other woman&rsquo;s children, the more she may do. But
I should hope your mother was too proud to let herself be
used as a nursemaid to her own nieces.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s never proud where children are concerned,&rdquo; answered
Medora. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll stop there till she&rsquo;s worn out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A very gloomy picture and I hope you&rsquo;re wrong, Mrs.
Dingle,&rdquo; he answered.</p>

<small>THE LETTER</small></h2></div>


<p>In the vat house there took place the transformation from
liquid to solid, from pulp to paper, from a gruel-like,
tenuous compound to a substance strong enough to stand
strain of many pounds and last for centuries.</p>

<p>Here was the largest building in the Mill&mdash;a very lofty,
brightly lighted, airy hall, from whose open roof descended
electric lights hanging above each vat. A steady whirr
and throb of noisy engines made a din here, but the vatmen
and their couchers were used to it and could hear
themselves speak through the familiar riot.</p>

<p>To the right, elevated under the roof, stood the range
of chests&mdash;huge, round vessels, like little gasometers,
into which the pulp descended from Ned Dingle when he
had perfected it. There were eight of these fat monsters
ranged in a row, and from them flowed the material to the
vats as it was needed. The vats stood on the floor of the
chamber&mdash;large, wide-mouthed troughs heated by steam
from within. For the pulp is warm for the vatman, and
some of the finest and most enduring papers demand such
a high temperature that an operative&rsquo;s hands are blistered
and boiled at his work. Beside each vat is a hand-box of
cold water, to dip and refresh the vatman&rsquo;s fingers when
the need arises.</p>

<p>Within the vat revolves the &ldquo;hog,&rdquo; a toothed roller,
which keeps the heavy pulp mixed and moving, and prevents
any settlement of the fibre.</p>

<p>On stages before the breasts of the vats stood the paper
makers, and the wooden bands against which they leaned
were polished with the friction of their aprons. Their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
tools were two&mdash;the mould&mdash;a flat, rectangular tray, or
sieve, of copper wire as fine as gauze, with the water-mark
let in upon it to tell the story of the future paper, and
the deckle&mdash;a light wood and metal frame of four sides
which fitted exactly over the mould and lifted an edge all
round it to hold the pulp. The moulds varied from the
size of two open sheets of notepaper, to great squares of
&ldquo;double elephant,&rdquo; the noblest stuff the Mill produced.
Moulds for these immense pieces once immersed in the
pulp, called for great physical power to draw them cleanly
and steadily back from the clinging fluid with their weight
of material spread upon them.</p>

<p>Kellock was making &ldquo;double elephant&rdquo; in a mighty
mould. With his thumbs firmly set on the deckle edge,
he lowered the tray into the snow-white pulp, sloping it
towards him as he did so. He put it in, sank it flat under
the pulp and drew it out again with one beautiful,
rhythmic movement.</p>

<p>The pulp sucked hard at the great mould, to drag it to
the depths, but the man&rsquo;s strength brought it steadily
forth; and then he made his &ldquo;stroke&rdquo;&mdash;a complicated
gesture, which levelled and settled the pulp on the mould
and let the liquid escape through the gauze. Kellock gave
a little jog to the right and to the left and ended with an
indescribable, subtle, quivering movement which completed
the task. It was the work of two seconds, and in his
case a beautiful accomplishment full of grace and charm.
He stood easily and firmly while every muscle of breast
and arm, back and loins played its appointed part in the
&ldquo;stroke.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Trood often stood and watched Jordan for the
pleasure of the sight. It was the most perfect style he
had ever seen. He was a theorist and calculated that
Kellock produced the very greatest amount of physical
power for the least possible expenditure of muscular loss;
while others, who made as good paper as he, squandered
thousands of pounds of dynamical energy by a stroke full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
of superfluous gesture. But the stroke is never the same
in any two vatmen. It develops, with each artificer&rsquo;s
knowledge of the craft, to produce that highly co-ordinated
effort embraced in the operation of making a sheet of
paper.</p>

<p>Mr. Knox operated at the next vat and offered an object
lesson. He did the same things that Kellock did; dipped
his mould, drew it to him, brought it squarely out, jogged
to right and left and gave that subtle, complex touch of
completion; yet in his achievement a wholly different display
met the observer. It seemed that he performed a
piece of elaborate ritual before the altar of the vat.</p>

<p>He bowed his head to right and left; he moved his
tongue and his knees; he jerked his elbows and bent his
back over the trough as a priest consecrating the elements
of some sacramental mass. Then he bowed and
nodded once more and the created sheet emerged from
his mould. The effect was grotesque, and seen at a little
distance a stranger had supposed that Mr. Knox was
simply playing the fool for the amusement of his coucher
and layer; but in reality he was working hard and making
as fine and perfect paper as Kellock himself. His
muscles were tuned to his task; he had lifted his sheer
weight of forty tons or more by the end of the day and
was none the worse for it. Nor could he have omitted
one gesture from his elaborate style without upsetting
everything and losing his stroke.</p>

<p>So the transformation became accomplished and the
millions of linen and cotton fibres scooped on to the mould
ran into a thin mat or wad, which was a piece of paper.
Why all these fragile and microscopic atoms should become
so inter-twisted and mingled that they produce an
integral fabric, it is difficult to understand; but this was
the result of the former processes; and those to come
would change the slab of wet, newly created stuff&mdash;now
no more than a piece of soaked blotting-paper&mdash;to the
perfected sheet.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>His stroke accomplished and the sediment levelled on
the mould, Kellock brought his mould to the &ldquo;stay&rdquo;&mdash;a
brass-bound ledge on his left hand. He lifted the deckle
from it as he did so and the full mould was drawn up the
stay to the &ldquo;asp,&rdquo; where his coucher stood. Then Kellock
clasped the deckle on to his second mould, now returned
from the coucher, and dipped again, while his assistant,
taking the full mould from the asp, turned it over on to
the accumulating pile of sheets rising on his plank. Then
he ran the empty mould back along the bridge to Kellock&rsquo;s
hand and drew to himself the next full mould now waiting
for him on the stay.</p>

<p>So the process was endlessly repeated, and when the
coucher&rsquo;s pile of paper, with woollen welts between each
new sheet, had grown large enough, it was removed, drawn
away on a little trolley, which ran upon rails down the
centre of the vat house, and taken to a press. Here the
mass under a steady strain showed that the new sheets
were still half water, for a fountain poured and spurted
away on every side as the lever was turned.</p>

<p>From this initial pressing each pile came back to the
place of its creation and the layer, the third worker in the
trinity at each vat, separated the paper from the woollens
between the sheets and handed the felts back to the coucher
as he needed them for his own task. The three men
worked together like a machine with rhythmic action and
wonderful swiftness. Then came the interval; the din of
the machinery ceased for a while and the vatmen washed
their hands.</p>

<p>Each manual craft leaves its own marks, by which one
skilled may tell a worker&rsquo;s business, and the paper maker&rsquo;s
hands are deeply corned and calloused along the palms
and joints. They are his stock in trade and he takes the
utmost care of them, for a bleeding corn, or cut, or any
wound instantly disables him and he cannot tend the vat
until they are sound again.</p>

<p>At this moment Robert Life was out of action, with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
sore on his thumb, and employed for the time at other
labour; but he joined the men in the dinner hour and
shared a discussion concerning the supreme disaster which
may fall to the vatman&rsquo;s lot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you ever lose your stroke?&rdquo; asked Life of Mr.
Knox. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard of men that did&mdash;and never got it
back no more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;May it never happen to you, Robert,&rdquo; answered the
elder, &ldquo;for anything more dreadful and shattering you
can&rsquo;t imagine. Yes, I lost my stroke eight years ago;
and I can remember every item of the tragedy as if it was
yesterday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Along of illness?&rdquo; asked Life, &ldquo;or your own fault?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As I&rsquo;m among friends,&rdquo; replied Philander, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll confess
that it was my own fault. I tell you these things as
a warning to you younger men. It was whiskey. I&rsquo;d
go on the burst sometimes, though never what you&rsquo;d call
a drinker. But I held an opinion it was better to have
a fair wallow in it now and again with teetotal intervals,
than to be always drinking, you see; and once I overdid
it and lost my stroke. I came to the vat and dipped,
but the touch was gone. I tried and failed and washed
off again and again; but I couldn&rsquo;t make paper. They
came round me and said hopeful things, and I stood like
a stuck pig among &rsquo;em and the sweat poured down my
face. Then I dropped the mould and sneaked away and
felt as if the end of the world had come. For I knew
bitter well that often and often the stroke once lost is
never got back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You got yours back, however?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In my terror I signed the pledge and promised the
Almighty a lot of very fine things if He&rsquo;d be merciful and
let me regain my skill. My self-respect was gone and I&rsquo;d
have grovelled to God, or anybody who could help me.
My foreman was a very good chap and understood the
nature of the disaster. He cheered me and felt so positive
sure I should get it back, that I began to think I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
should myself. For in such case half the battle is to
have cheerful, hopeful people about you, who&rsquo;ll make light
of the tragedy and say it&rsquo;s going to be all right. The
moral effect of that helps you to hope against hope and
recover your nerve, when you come to try again. It&rsquo;s
all nerve really, and if you can get back your nerve, then
you&rsquo;ll probably get back your stroke.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At the third trial I got mine back anyway, and &rsquo;twas
a very fine example of the best in human nature to see
how my coucher and layer shook hands with me when I
made my first sheet and how glad my fellow vatmen were
about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And did you keep all your good promises?&rdquo; asked
Kellock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For practical purposes, yes,&rdquo; answered Philander.
&ldquo;I improved a good bit after that adventure and never
went on the burst again. The pledge, however, I did not
keep, because by experiment I found I could work better
on beer than water; but spirits are a thing of the past.
I don&rsquo;t drink more than a whiskey or two a week now-a-days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kellock, at one stage in his secret thoughts at this season,
had found his heart faint somewhat, for by temperament
thus far he had been a thinker rather than a doer.
His work ended, his leisure had been largely devoted to
the welfare of his class, and he doubted not that he would
turn a great part of his energies to labour questions
and even abandon paper-making for a political career
some day. Such was his dream; but for the present that
had been swept aside.</p>

<p>Thoughts of his own future gave him no lasting uneasiness.
Whether he stopped at Dene, or went elsewhere,
after running away with Mrs. Dingle, mattered nothing
to him. His skill commanded a ready market and he
could get work for the asking. He guessed, indeed, that
Medora must desire to live as far from the haunts of her
tragedy as possible; but he also knew that Matthew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
Trenchard would wish to keep him if he could. A more
pressing problem concerned the future of Medora&rsquo;s husband.
Kellock&rsquo;s orderly mind above all things would have
liked to go to Ned, state the case clearly, prove to him
that he was never destined to make his wife a happy
woman and frankly suggest a change of partners for
Medora. He was actually tempted to do this, and even
went so far as to suggest it to Mrs. Dingle; but she, hiding
a secret amazement at any enterprise so unromantic,
assured him that such an action could only serve greatly
to complicate their future if it did not actually ruin their
plans altogether.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he was like you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and could listen to
sense it might work; but you don&rsquo;t want to get your head
broken, Jordan, and that&rsquo;s all that would happen. The
more he knows he&rsquo;s wrong and being wicked to me, the
more he&rsquo;d fight to keep me. He&rsquo;s got into a horrible way
of torturing me now. He properly feeds on my sufferings
I believe. It&rsquo;s now or never, for he&rsquo;s breaking me
down and I shan&rsquo;t be company for any man much longer.
Don&rsquo;t think I want to make a scene, or add difficulties to
your life. God knows I only want to be your right hand,
and help you, and work as best I can for all the noble
things you mean to do. But before that happens, you&rsquo;ve
got to play the hero a bit I&rsquo;m afraid, and meet his brute
force with your bravery and courage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In fact Medora would not have missed the necessary
theatricals for the world, and a peaceful interchange of
husbands did not at all appeal to her. She had no desire
to forego the excitement or the fame. She had
thought a thousand times of the hum at the Mill when
her place knew her no more, and there came the news that
she had left her husband for a better and greater man.
Probably she loved Kellock after a fashion; certainly she
believed she did. In the unreal atmosphere that she now
breathed, it seemed to her that Kellock was about to play
Perseus to her Andromeda; but she had no wish that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
matter should be settled amicably with the dragon. Jordan
must do his part; otherwise her rle would be lessened
and reduced below the dignity proper to it.</p>

<p>Since Ned was to blame for everything, reason demanded
that retribution fall upon him. Only so could
justice&mdash;poetical or otherwise&mdash;be done. If her departure
were not to inflict adequate punishment upon him,
then the salt was out of the situation. To Kellock this
sounded vindictive, but he could not deny that it was human
and natural. He remembered that Medora must not
be expected to consider Ned&rsquo;s feelings; though secretly he
wished that she had been able to do so.</p>

<p>But Medora was out for blood and her carnivorous instincts
extended even to Kellock himself. He too must
suffer, that she might complete her performance with
due triumph. She pictured Jordan ostracised and turning
to her for comfort and support. She saw herself
doubted, misunderstood, but presently triumphing over
everybody. She imagined Kellock lifted to heights unattainable
without her steadfast aid. She felt a boundless
confidence in her own intelligence and inspiration to
help him. But he must certainly run away with her as
a preliminary. He must outrage convention, focus all
eyes and appear in the lurid light that beats on people
who have the courage to do such things. She told him
so and assisted at the simple preliminaries.</p>

<p>He was about to take a fortnight&rsquo;s holiday and it was
decided that a day after he left Dene, Medora would join
him at Newton Abbot and proceed to London with him.</p>

<p>He agreed to this arrangement as the most seemly, and
together they concocted the letter which Mr. Dingle would
receive by post on the morning of Medora&rsquo;s disappearance.
She invited Jordan to assist her in this composition, but
was sorry afterwards that she had done so, for her lover
differed from her on certain particulars and deprecated
the writing of several things that she desired to write.</p>

<p>They planned the communication in the secrecy of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
Priory ruin on a Sunday afternoon, and it was some time
before the man had produced a clean draft for Medora to
take away and copy. She wished to insert a demand,
couched somewhat insolently, that Mr. Dingle would divorce
his wife as swiftly as possible; but Kellock forbade
this, because he felt that advice to Ned under such circumstances
was undignified and altogether improper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You must be reasonable
and take it in a high-minded way. It&rsquo;s for you to
tell him what you&rsquo;re going to do and the reason; but it
ain&rsquo;t for you to tell him what he&rsquo;s got to do. You can
safely leave that to him. You see in these cases, when
they get in the papers, that a man and woman always go
to an hotel together; and when that&rsquo;s proved, the other
man divorces her as a matter of course. That&rsquo;s all there
is to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At other points also he declined to support Medora&rsquo;s
wishes. She had designed some rather flagrant sentiments
for this letter and felt that her action needed them. It
was to be the letter of her life and, as she said, it had
become her first wish to make Dingle feel what he had
made her feel. But Kellock was calm and collected upon
the subject, and finding composition of the letter awakened
very considerably passion in Medora, he begged her
to let him draft it and accept his idea of what such a
document should be.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may be read in open Court some day,&rdquo; he said&mdash;a
possibility that cheered her.</p>

<p>She agreed therefore and hid her disappointment at
what she regarded as a very colourless indictment. Jordan&rsquo;s
idea was something as lifeless as a lawyer&rsquo;s letter,
but equally crushing in its cold and remorseless statement
of fact. Not a shadow of emotion marked it. There
was nothing but the statement that finding she failed to
please or satisfy her husband, and knowing their continued
union could only destroy their happiness and self-control
and self-respect, therefore&mdash;for both their sakes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>&mdash;Medora
had decided to leave Ned and cast in her lot
with Jordan Kellock, who was willing and anxious to make
her his wife. Neither anger nor sorrow appeared in this
communication as it left Kellock&rsquo;s hands.</p>

<p>She took the letter and thanked him gratefully for helping
her. Then they tore up into very tiny fragments the
various attempts before the finished article and so parted&mdash;not
to meet again until they met for ever.</p>

<p>And Medora, when alone, read his letter again and liked
it less than before. That night her husband was out and
she began her transcription, but when it came actually to
copying Kellock&rsquo;s sentences, their icy restraint began to
annoy her. She stopped once or twice to ask herself how
it was possible for any human being to write in a manner
so detached. First she praised him for such amazing
power and such remarkable reserve; then she reminded herself
that this was to be her letter to her husband, not
Jordan&rsquo;s. Jordan proposed to write himself from London.
She wondered a great deal what Jordan&rsquo;s letter
would be like. If the letter he had written for her made
her shiver, surely the letter he wrote for himself would
be a freezing matter. She told herself that Kellock was
a saint. She felt uneasily proud of him already. She
kept his heroism in her mind, and felt proud of herself,
too, that such a man was willing to let her share his future,
brilliant as it must certainly be.</p>

<p>But the letter&mdash;her letter&mdash;stuck. She began arguing
with herself about it. She told herself that it was not
her style and Ned would know it. Obviously Ned must
not suppose that Kellock had written the letter. She
noted down a few sentences of the sort of letter she would
have written without anybody&rsquo;s assistance&mdash;the letter
she had dreamed of writing&mdash;and it pleased her much.
She found such a flow of words as seemed proper to the
tremendous occasion. They glittered and flashed like
knives. Invective and self-justification shared the burning
pages. She surprised herself at the force and vigour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
of the phrases. Turning again to Kellock&rsquo;s composition,
she now found it hopelessly inadequate as compared with
her own. It was true that she had promised Jordan to
post it; but she changed her mind and determined to
despatch her own production, as better suited to the
parting, far more forcible, far more dramatic and far
more the sort of letter she pictured Ned as showing to
other people, after the blow had fallen.</p>

<p>She paltered with the situation to the extent of writing
another letter embodying a part of Kellock&rsquo;s. And
then she copied this, and copied it again. She destroyed
the debris, including Kellock&rsquo;s original draft, and left
one letter perfect in every way&mdash;an exceedingly outrageous
production.</p>

<p>She sealed it up and next morning assured herself that,
for all practical purposes, it was the letter Kellock had
designed. From a decision to tell him that she had added
a phrase or two, she doubted whether it was worth while.
Finally she determined not to tell him that she had altered
the letter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no good making needless complications,&rdquo; she
thought.</p>

<p>She was very happy and excited. She lived in a dream
for a week, and the reality of the things she had decided
to do lay altogether outside her calculations and anticipations.</p>

<p>Probably her greatest joy at this juncture centred, not
so much in the happiness she had planned for herself and
Jordan, as the thought of what people would say at Dene
about their flight. She felt that to be invisible among her
acquaintances on the morning of her departure, would have
been even a greater delight than the first day in London
with her future husband.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br />

<small>LYDIA&rsquo;S DAY</small></h2></div>


<p>Lydia Trivett always remembered the seventeenth day of
March as the most remarkable anniversary in her career.
For upon that day she experienced such a succession of
extraordinary and unexpected shocks and strains, that,
looking back afterwards, she marvelled how any human
mind was strong enough to endure them and not break
down under such massive and accumulated provocation.</p>

<p>Enough adventures overtook Lydia on the seventeenth
of March to suffice a well balanced woman for ten years.</p>

<p>The day was Sunday and opened without incident; but
hardly had Mrs. Trivett got her brother&rsquo;s children off to
church, when Tom Dolbear descended from his wife with
the news that he was going for the doctor and calling for
the nurse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-day makes or mars me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If &rsquo;tis another
girl, Lydia, I don&rsquo;t know how I&rsquo;ll bear up against
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be hopeful,&rdquo; she urged. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a law called the
law of averages, so Mr. Knox tells me, and according to
that, a boy&rsquo;s very nearly certain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Mr. Dolbear did not understand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell the man he&rsquo;s a fool then,&rdquo; he answered as he laced
up his boots. &ldquo;Children can&rsquo;t be regulated by law, though
it&rsquo;s just like the cussed conceit of lawyers to think they
can. And God help us if they could ordain these things,
for they&rsquo;d drive tidy hard bargains I&rsquo;ll warrant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a law of nature, not of lawyers,&rdquo; explained his
sister. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know nothing about it myself, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
common sense is that after such a lot of girls, you&rsquo;ve a
right to expect a boy, and no doubt so it will be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He departed and Lydia went to Mary. She was in no
way concerned for her, because Mrs. Dolbear managed
these matters very successfully and with the least possible
trouble to herself. Nature invariably smiled upon her
and her present anxiety merely echoed her husband&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;God send it&rsquo;s a man-child, or else I shan&rsquo;t hear the
last of it,&rdquo; she murmured.</p>

<p>All was ready to welcome the new-comer and in half an
hour Mrs. Dolbear&rsquo;s ally, Mrs. Damerell from the village,
joined her. The children came home from church and
Lydia gave them their dinner and told them that a new
brother or sister was about to arrive. They shared the
family ambition and prayed Aunt Lydia to let it be a
brother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it will be,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but that&rsquo;s for God to
decide.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nobody don&rsquo;t want no more girls,&rdquo; declared the eldest
daughter, and her aunt told her not to speak so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t what we want; &rsquo;tis what our Father in Heaven
wants, Milly. And if He sends father and mother a little
girl, we must welcome it just so hearty as you and your
sisters were welcomed in your turn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Dolbear was restless, but he ate as good a dinner
as usual and then, having heard that all was going well,
went into the orchard with his pipe. The children were
despatched to Sunday school and presently an old doctor
arrived, visited Mary and then joined the farmer under
the apple trees.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A matter of form,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I come as a matter of
form, Tom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Dolbear enquired as to the law of averages, and
the medical man advised him to set no faith upon it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When you&rsquo;re dealing with the statistics and the population
as a whole, such things work out pretty regular, I
grant you,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;but when you&rsquo;re dealing with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
one woman, who has got into a habit, then it&rsquo;s not wise
to indulge in general principles. Habit is stronger than
anything but death, Tom; and though you may fairly
hope for a son, I may say in sporting language that the
betting is a shade against.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think &rsquo;twill be a girl, doctor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do&mdash;not long odds, but about two to one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Within doors Lydia was standing reading a letter with
shaking hands, while silent, strained, staring, humped up
in the chair opposite her, sat Ned Dingle. He had come
from Ashprington, burst in upon her while she was helping
a maiden to wash up, ordered her to follow him to the
parlour and then broken the fatal news.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s gone&mdash;run away&mdash;Medora,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She
rose afore I was awake this morning, and when I came
down house, I got this to breakfast. The post-man
brought it, just as I was wondering what the mischief
had become of her. Read it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He handed Lydia Medora&rsquo;s epistle and sat and watched
her while she read it. He did not interrupt but kept his
eyes on her face and gnawed his knuckles as she read.</p>

<p>When she had finished, she let the fatal sheet fall on the
ground and took off her glasses. Then she bent down and
picked up the letter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A cheerful, damned sort of thing for a husband to
get,&rdquo; said Ned. &ldquo;Going to marry Kellock, you see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As to that, she&rsquo;ll marry Kellock when you please and
not before,&rdquo; answered Lydia quietly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
what to say to you, Ned. This is beyond anything. I
never guessed for a moment she&rsquo;d sink to such wickedness.
God&rsquo;s my judge I didn&rsquo;t know she was having any truck
with that man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The nurse looked in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s doctor?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the orchard with Mr. Dolbear,&rdquo; answered Lydia.
Mrs. Damerell departed and she turned again to Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an insulting letter. I&rsquo;m terribly shocked. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
don&rsquo;t pretend to understand the rising generation, my
dear. After they grow out of childhood, they get too
deep for me. But I couldn&rsquo;t have thought any daughter
of mine and my husband&rsquo;s would ever have done this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very plain to understand now,&rdquo; he answered.
&ldquo;She wanted that man and she couldn&rsquo;t chuck me without
some sort of excuse, so she worked up this idea, that
I was a brute and tormenting her to death and so on.
Then she made Kellock believe it; and though he kept
perfectly straight, so far as I know, while he thought Medora
was happily married to me, as soon as she began
about me being a cruel devil that made her life hell and
all that, then Kellock no doubt believed her. Why, he
went so far as to lecture me a while back along, and I
knocked him in the water for doing so. I&rsquo;ll swear he
had no thought to run away with her then&mdash;unless he&rsquo;s
the biggest traitor that ever walked the earth. But he
ain&rsquo;t that sort. I simply can&rsquo;t see that man doing this
job.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you can keep so cool and sensible, Ned.
Nothing&rsquo;s gained by getting angered, though I&rsquo;m angered
I promise you, and anger&rsquo;s a righteous thing sometimes.
I&rsquo;m struck to the heart over this; and if I&rsquo;d thought for
an instant &rsquo;twas in her wicked mind even as a shadow,
I&rsquo;d have given you due notice. But I never dreamed it.
I&rsquo;ve talked to her again and again and tried to show her
sense; but she&rsquo;s doomed herself by her own nature.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The mischief is I couldn&rsquo;t read her,&rdquo; answered Mr.
Dingle. &ldquo;Not that I didn&rsquo;t at first. She married me
for love&mdash;no other reason&mdash;and for the first six months&mdash;nay
ten&mdash;of our life together, I read her like a book.
But after that she changed. And she got stranger and
stranger, as we went on, till be damned if I didn&rsquo;t find myself
living with a different woman! And, mind this, I was
never rough nor harsh to her, till she&rsquo;d egged me on to
being so. I put up with a devil of a lot and kept my
temper in a manner that surprised myself if not her; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
she was out to make me lose it, because, till I did so, the
things she wanted to happen couldn&rsquo;t. And after a bit
I did lose it. Who wouldn&rsquo;t? Yet God&rsquo;s my judge I
was never very much enraged with her, because I always
felt she was play-acting and making believe half the time;
and that had a funny side; and sometimes it amused me
more than it angered me. And above that was the sure
knowledge that any open quarrel would be an unmanly
thing and might lead to lasting trouble; and above that,
again, was the fact that I loved Medora well. I never
ceased to love her in her maddest tantrums.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then comes this letter, and I can assure you it&rsquo;s a
bolt from the blue. And yet it&rsquo;s all unreal somehow&mdash;I
can&rsquo;t grasp it home to me. I can&rsquo;t believe it. I could
almost laugh and say to myself it&rsquo;s a dream and I shall
wake up alongside Medora any minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His face was full of pain, as yet he showed more stunned
surprise than anger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew her so well&mdash;think of it,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;She
must have her bit of fun and her bit of flattery; and she
got both with me. But him&mdash;good God Almighty&mdash;she
turned him down once for all eighteen months ago, and
she told me why in very good plain words. And now she&rsquo;s
gone to him. Yet he&rsquo;s not changed. He can&rsquo;t change.
There&rsquo;s men I can see her with perhaps&mdash;though none as
easy as I can see her with me&mdash;but him&mdash;Kellock&mdash;he&rsquo;ll
never satisfy her. It&rsquo;s impossible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right there,&rdquo; said Lydia. &ldquo;My daughter&rsquo;s
not the sort to be content to shine with her husband&rsquo;s reflected
light. The little fool wants to be somebody herself.
It&rsquo;s vanity quite as much as wickedness has made her do
this. But she won&rsquo;t shine with Kellock anyway; and
after doing such a hateful, wicked thing, he won&rsquo;t shine
either. His light&rsquo;s out now in the eyes of all self-respecting,
honourable people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;It will make a deuce of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
a lot of difference to Medora, but not to him, because
he&rsquo;s the sort that don&rsquo;t let any outward thing alter their
inward disposition. He&rsquo;s thought it all out. He knows
there&rsquo;s not half a dozen men in the kingdom can make
paper like him, and so he&rsquo;s safe and beyond any punishment
whatever he does. He&rsquo;s done nothing the law can
touch him for. And when I touch him, the law will be on
his side against me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ned was still amazingly calm. Indeed his self-control
astonished her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So far I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s happening,&rdquo; he proceeded.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where they are, or what they have planned.
I&rsquo;m keeping an open mind. I shall see him presently. I
may swing for him yet; or I may find&mdash;Lord knows what
I may find. It&rsquo;s all hidden so far.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I feel as if I was twenty years older for this news&mdash;older
and broken too,&rdquo; said Lydia. &ldquo;If there was time,
I&rsquo;d weep a river for this, and I shall yet; but not now.
There&rsquo;s a baby coming upstairs, and you can&rsquo;t think of
two things to once and do &rsquo;em both justice. I&rsquo;ll see you
to-morrow in the dinner hour. Perhaps you&rsquo;ll hear more
by then. Kellock was a man very nice on speech, as well
as manners. He&rsquo;ll feel it&rsquo;s up to him to&mdash;there, what
am I saying?&mdash;the strangeness! Well may you say as
though you was in a dream. So I feel; and I won&rsquo;t
throw up hope either. God often waits till the very last
minute afore He throws the light of truth into a mind.
He may prevail with Medora, and so I wouldn&rsquo;t say nothing
yet&mdash;nothing to nobody.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m dazed,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;I scarce know what I&rsquo;ve
been doing since breakfast. Here&rsquo;s your children coming
back from Sunday school. I&rsquo;ll be gone. It&rsquo;s a bad job&mdash;an
ugly, cruel job; but grasp hold of this tight, and
whether you tell or whether you do not tell, remember the
fault weren&rsquo;t mine. I never treated her bad, not yet bullied
her, nor played tyrant upon her; and if she said I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
did, she was a liar; and if ever I handled her rough, I was
sorry after; and the worst ever I did weren&rsquo;t a twentieth
part of what she deserved.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know all that,&rdquo; said Lydia; then the children clattered
down the passage with shrill questions: &ldquo;Be the
baby come?&rdquo; &ldquo;Be it a boy?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, say &rsquo;tis a boy,
Aunt Lydia!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ned went off through the orchards, while his mother-in-law,
scarce knowing what she did, gave the children
their tea.</p>

<p>Under the trees Mr. Dolbear padded up and down.
He was in no fear for Mary, but suffering the extremity
of anxiety as to the sex of the coming child.</p>

<p>Ned told him the news.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My wife&rsquo;s run away from me, Tom,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have she? Fancy! The Lord gives and the Lord
takes away. Blessed be the Name. I never did like Medora,
and you&rsquo;ll bear me out. Where&rsquo;s she run then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. She&rsquo;s gone with Jordan Kellock, the
vatman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;God&rsquo;ll see to it&mdash;trust Him, and don&rsquo;t take the law
in your own hands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They talked for ten minutes; then a child appeared at
the gate by the house. It was Milly, Mr. Dolbear&rsquo;s favourite.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The news be come,&rdquo; cried Tom, and ignoring Dingle,
he hastened to his daughter, while Ned departed. The
first shock was over and his deep disgrace and bitter wrong
began to grind into him. So far he had kept amazingly
temperate. But he was to experience many moods before
he slept that night.</p>

<p>Meantime Milly in tears broke bad news to the farmer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s another beastly little girl come,&rdquo; she piped,
and her father gazed tragically at her and turned silently
to his home. Lydia met him at the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did Ned tell you of this awful misfortune?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Milly told me, and I say here
and now that it&rsquo;s an outrage and undeserved.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking of Medora, Tom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Dolbear had no room in his mind for Medora. The
children were all cast down and some wept.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must go and comfort the woman,&rdquo; said Mary&rsquo;s husband.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll feel this only less than I do. And I should
like to hear parson justify it&mdash;not that he could. Just
a piece of saucy cruelty against them who&rsquo;ve done nought
to deserve it. That&rsquo;s what it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you go souring her mind against the baby,&rdquo;
urged Lydia. &ldquo;That wouldn&rsquo;t be kind after all her trouble
and patience. Say you&rsquo;re pleased, Tom, and cheer
her up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twould only be a lie if I did and nobody would know
it better than her. I&rsquo;ll go up and forget myself and comfort
her as best I can&mdash;and God&rsquo;s my judge, Lydia, I
won&rsquo;t have no more children.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you say what you&rsquo;ll be sorry for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean it. Them that plant the seed have a right to
call the crops in my opinion; and there did ought to be
fair give and take between the creature and his Creator.
There weren&rsquo;t no rhyme nor reason in planting another
girl on me, and I ain&rsquo;t going to be the plaything of the
Almighty no more&mdash;and more shan&rsquo;t Mary. We&rsquo;ve done&mdash;through
no fault of our own neither.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He ascended to a weary and apologetic partner who
shared his view of the situation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the living daps of the last,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;A nice
little, heavy girl; but I can&rsquo;t do no more, Tom; I can&rsquo;t
fight against Providence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No you can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;and what&rsquo;s more, you
shan&rsquo;t. You&rsquo;ve broke the law of averages by all accounts;
and that&rsquo;s about the limit. And Somebody shall see that
two can play at that game in the future. Providence have
shut down on the boys; and I&rsquo;ll shut down on the girls.
It ain&rsquo;t going to be all one way.&rdquo;</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>Mrs. Dolbear shed tears, but she shared his indignation
and did not blame his attitude to the baby.</p>

<p>Mrs. Damerell was shocked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t open my mouth so wide if I was you,
farmer,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Who are you to dictate what
you want? Here&rsquo;s a fine female child come into the world,
to be your right hand and the joy of your life for all you
know to the contrary. I&rsquo;m sure I never yet saw a pair
receive a child in such a way, since the day that Honor
Michelmore got one with no thumbs and cussed God.
But in your case, Nature have always done her part to
the full, and you&rsquo;re saying things you didn&rsquo;t ought, Mr.
Dolbear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re so pleased with it, you&rsquo;d better take it home
with you,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;It never can be no favourite
of mine now, and I won&rsquo;t pretend different.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Beneath Lydia was seeking to allay the disappointment
of the family.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if she was the nicest little sister
any of you ever had, my dears. A proper little fairy very
likely, and the one you&rsquo;ll all like best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They vowed it never could be and Milly said: &ldquo;Father
hates her a&rsquo;ready, so I be going to do the same.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Trivett preached very seriously against this
inhuman spirit and was still preaching when there came
Philander Knox.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought the better the day the better the deed,&rdquo; he
explained, &ldquo;and I hoped your young people would be going
to church after their tea, so I might have a yarn with
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very kind of you, I&rsquo;m sure. Perhaps you&rsquo;ll be able
to distract my brother&rsquo;s mind a thought. He&rsquo;s very much
under the weather. And I dare say it would be a good
thing if a few of you was to go to church.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Milly, who loved church, but did not often attend evening
service, was pleased at this plan and she took her
younger sisters with her. Tom came down, smoked a pipe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
and grew calmer in the company of Mr. Knox; Lydia put
the other children to bed&mdash;for the present the penultimate
baby was in her room&mdash;and then Philander&rsquo;s opportunity
arrived, and after Mr. Dolbear had gone up the
village, he enjoyed Lydia&rsquo;s society for half an hour before
interruption came.</p>

<p>She told him what had happened to Medora and he
wondered, while he discussed the tragedy, whether it might
not, after all, help rather than hinder his own designs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At first sight,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the human instinct is always
to say that anything out of the common must be wrong;
but that&rsquo;s only our natural cowardice and love of letting
life alone. And I, for one, am not going to say that because
a woman changes husbands, or a man changes wives,
it follows they are doing the wrong thing. Often a pinch
of pluck will break a partnership to the advantage of both
parties, and it&rsquo;s a darned sight better than shaking their
chains and making a nuisance of themselves in the face
of the people. An unhappy marriage is a bad advertisement
for the institution, and a man like me, who believes
heart and soul in marriage, is always sorry to see an unhappy
marriage go on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But if every young pair who quarrelled before their
first child came was to part like this, the world couldn&rsquo;t
go on. Those that God have joined let no man put
asunder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No man can,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t worry
about that. If God joins up a man and woman, man can&rsquo;t
put &rsquo;em asunder, nor yet anything else. They&rsquo;re one
body and soul till death parts &rsquo;em. But because a pair
marry, it don&rsquo;t follow that God have had anything to do
with it. There&rsquo;s a lot of other institutions besides God.
We make mistakes in all walks of life and in none oftener
than in marriage. And in my opinion it&rsquo;s one of the
things, like any other partnership, that God don&rsquo;t specially
take under His protection. Love is a trick of nature,
and Nature says to herself, &lsquo;if at first you don&rsquo;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
succeed, try again.&rsquo; Nature&rsquo;s trying again with your
daughter, Mrs. Trivett.&rdquo; </p>

<p>She sighed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish to Heaven as Nature had left her alone then,
for she was married to a good man, and whatever she feels
about him, there&rsquo;s no doubt he was ready and willing
enough to love her to the end of his life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It often happens,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;and of course that
sort of parting&rsquo;s the saddest, where one party don&rsquo;t want
to part and t&rsquo;other does. When both are fed up, then
they can break loose with self-respect and mutual applause;
but if one&rsquo;s got to run away from the other, then
the case is altered. But no doubt Ned Dingle will rise
to it. He&rsquo;s clever enough to know that it&rsquo;s useless keeping
a wife if she&rsquo;s breaking her heart to escape. The fact
that Medora has done this venturesome act and gone to
another man, will show your son-in-law the game&rsquo;s up.
If she&rsquo;d just gone off on her own, he might have hunted
after her and won her back perhaps&mdash;if he wanted her
back; but since she&rsquo;s gone with somebody else and is ready
to face all that means&mdash;well, that leaves her husband in
no doubt of her meaning, don&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;None whatever,&rdquo; admitted Lydia. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a
brain, Mr. Knox, so perhaps you&rsquo;ll tell me what you think
of Kellock. She was divided between &rsquo;em in the past and
decided for Ned&mdash;wisely as I thought, because it always
seemed to me that Jordan Kellock was too wrapped up in
reading and learning and high views about labour to
make a young woman happy. If you&rsquo;d asked me, I should
have said it weren&rsquo;t in him to run away with another man&rsquo;s
wife. I should have thought he was such a well-drilled
man in his mind that he&rsquo;d have stopped loving Medora the
moment he heard she was going to marry Dingle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kellock,&rdquo; answered Philander Knox, &ldquo;is all you say;
but he&rsquo;s young and he&rsquo;s got a romantical turn, though it
takes the practical shape of wanting to better the world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
at large. That&rsquo;s all true, but he&rsquo;s short of thirty still,
and, under thirty, you never can say with certainty a
man is complete in his make-up. He loved her, and if
he thought she&rsquo;d took a fatal mistake and married the
wrong one, and if she told him so, as no doubt she did,
then it&rsquo;s not out of his character to find himself loving her
again. And the instinct to fight the cause of the weak,
which is a part of the man, wouldn&rsquo;t be any less strong
because he happened to love the weak party for herself.
So it all fits in very natural so far, and your daughter
may trust Kellock to champion her and be very tender and
jealous and all that. He&rsquo;ll treat her well without a
doubt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what sort of a husband will he make for my
girl?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I can&rsquo;t say,&rdquo; answered Knox. &ldquo;For the reason
that I don&rsquo;t know what your girl wants. If Ned didn&rsquo;t
suit her, then as Kellock&rsquo;s just the opposite of him in
every way, perhaps he will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ned did suit her&mdash;that&rsquo;s the shocking thing,&rdquo; declared
Lydia. &ldquo;He suited her so perfectly that he suited
her too well, if you can understand that. There was all
sunshine and no shade, and Medora, so far as I can see,
instead of blessing her good luck got sick of so much uneventful
happiness, like a child gets sick of too much
barley-sugar. Then she turned by a sort of restless instinct
to find a bit of change. Of course she&rsquo;s said for
months that she was miserable; but she invented most of
her misery in my opinion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very interesting, and no doubt you know. But we
middle-aged people can always see the young looking for
trouble. &rsquo;Tis part of their natural curiosity and daring.
They don&rsquo;t know they&rsquo;re born in fact, and that&rsquo;s a
thing you can&rsquo;t teach a person. Each has got to learn
it themselves. And some never do. We&rsquo;ll watch and
pray, Mrs. Trivett. That&rsquo;s about all we can do for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
the young. And now I&rsquo;ll tell you what I came about.
And I&rsquo;ll also promise that, so far as it lies in my power,
I&rsquo;ll befriend Medora if she comes back here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She can&rsquo;t come back&mdash;she can&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leave her&mdash;you never know what the young can do,
and what they can&rsquo;t do. I&rsquo;m here about you, not her.
We&rsquo;ve not known each other above six months, but knowledge
of our fellow creatures ain&rsquo;t a matter of time. &rsquo;Tis
understanding of character and like to like and so on.
Another, finding you in trouble to-day, would hold off
no doubt. But, just because you are in trouble, I&rsquo;m
going to hold on and say what I came to say. I respect
and admire you very much out of the common, Mrs. Trivett,
and I feel that it&rsquo;s a crying shame to see you in this
rabbit hutch, living the life of a maid-of-all-work for other
people, when you ought to be the mistress of your own
home. I say you ought to have a man to work for you,
and look after you, and not let you toil and wear your
fingers to the bone, either here, over your brother&rsquo;s children,
or in the rag shop. Your sense of justice must cry
out against it, and so it ought and I feel it very much to
heart. You drew me, from the first minutes I set eyes
on you, for I saw all that you were and found, as I knew
you better, you were even better than I thought. And,
in a word, if you&rsquo;ll throw over these Dolbears and come
to me, I can promise a very faithful and friendly husband
and one who will make it his first business and pleasure
in life to give you a good time. &rsquo;Tis thought silly of a
man over fifty-two to speak of love; but rest assured that
such a man knows a darned sight more about it than green
youth. You&rsquo;ve had a good husband and I&rsquo;ve had a good
wife, according to her lights; then what&rsquo;s to prevent us
joining forces if you think half so well of me as I do of
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lydia was inconsequent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If anybody had told me when I opened my eyes this
morning what the day was going to bring forth,&rdquo; she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
said, &ldquo;God&rsquo;s my judge I shouldn&rsquo;t have had the heart,
or courage to put on my clothes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you would,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the sort to
meet all that comes steadfast and patient, with the pluck
of an army. You&rsquo;d have rose up as usual. And what
about it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing on earth is farther from my thoughts at present
than a second,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I regard myself as
an old woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only because you live among all these messy children.
You&rsquo;re not old: you&rsquo;re in your prime, and if you
was to rest your flesh a bit, instead of wearing it out
morning, noon and night, you&rsquo;d very soon be surprised
to find what a comely creature you&rsquo;d find yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all past. Duty is duty and God&rsquo;s found the
work to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;God&rsquo;s also found me,&rdquo; answered Mr. Knox, &ldquo;and you
must weigh me along with everything else. And if, as I
see in your face, your inclination is to say &lsquo;no,&rsquo; then I beg
you&rsquo;ll not say it&mdash;at any rate not this evening. You&rsquo;re
far too nice to decide the future career of a fellow creature,
let alone your own, without turning it over fairly
in your mind. I didn&rsquo;t ask you to say &lsquo;yes,&rsquo; all of a
minute, because this is sprung upon you&mdash;you expected
no such thing; but though I didn&rsquo;t count on &lsquo;yes,&rsquo; Lydia,
I&rsquo;m equally determined not to hear &lsquo;no.&rsquo; So you can
think all round it, and I wish you&rsquo;d got more time to do
so. However you&rsquo;re a fair woman&mdash;fair and just to
all but yourself&mdash;so I very well leave it at that for the
present.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To think a good-looking, clever man like you should
have looked at a little every-day woman like me!&rdquo; she
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t be every day no more if you&rsquo;re Mrs. Knox,&rdquo;
he promised. &ldquo;Far from it. You should go in a carriage
and pair if it could be done, and though I can&rsquo;t
promise that, I can promise a nice house, and a bit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
garden, and a professed cook to look after the kitchen
and do your bidding. Think upon it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hope, however; &rsquo;tis a very unlikely thing that
I should change my state with so many calls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come to your own conclusions anyway,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
know what human nature is very well and I know what you
are in this house. But don&rsquo;t let selfishness on the part of
other people decide you against me. That would be very
unfair to me, and you can&rsquo;t be unfair to a man that thinks
of you as I do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do nothing unfair to you, Mr. Knox. In fact I&rsquo;ll
do nothing at all for the present. My sister-in-law
mustn&rsquo;t hear a word in her weak state, or the consequences
might be bad; and my brother&rsquo;s cast down also,
and so am I. In fact trouble&rsquo;s everywhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Regard me as the silver lining to the cloud then. I
quite see it was a bit of a staggerer this coming to-day
of all days; but at any rate you know now you&rsquo;ve got a
valuable friend. And such I shall remain, whatever happens.
Now, no doubt, you&rsquo;re itching to get supper for
all them brats, so I&rsquo;ll go my way. And I pray God&rsquo;s
blessing on your thoughts, Lydia&mdash;I do indeed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Yes, you go now. I
can&rsquo;t stand no more, else I shall break down&mdash;a thing
I&rsquo;m never known to do. I dare say I&rsquo;ll see you at the
works to-morrow. And don&rsquo;t say nothing about Medora.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Trust me,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;My one hope will be to
help you in that quarter if I can. Don&rsquo;t you despair.
It may straighten out yet, though where two men and a
woman&rsquo;s the matter, there&rsquo;s seldom more than one chance
in fifty that things will come right.&rdquo;</p>

<small>MEDORA&rsquo;S NIGHT</small></h2></div>


<p>In a rowan-red gown and her best hat, Medora had left
Ashprington while it was yet twilight of morning. She
carried only a light travelling basket made of cane, for
she took little more than the clothes on her back. She
proposed to begin the new life in new clothes, which would
be bought in London. Even her wedding ring was left
behind and she told herself that she would not wear such
a thing again until Jordan Kellock set it on her finger.</p>

<p>She met him as they had arranged, at Newton Abbot,
and together they proceeded to London. He was serious
on the journey and extraordinarily solicitous for Medora&rsquo;s
mental and physical comfort. She told him all that she
had done and he explained his own purposes. At Bristol
he got her a cup of tea and a piece of cake. They had
enjoyed privacy so far; but now others entered the carriage
and they could talk no more. So Mrs. Dingle fell
back on her thoughts and pictured the sequence of events
at home, while Kellock read a newspaper. Her heart beat
high when London was reached and the train plunged into
Paddington.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we must practice a little guile, Medora,&rdquo;
he said as they walked down Praed Street, Jordan carrying
their luggage; &ldquo;but as little as possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They proceeded to Edgeware Road, where the man knew
a small hotel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep on your gloves for the moment,&rdquo; he advised.
&ldquo;The first thing I shall do to-morrow will be to buy you
a wedding ring.&rdquo;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>&ldquo;We are married,&rdquo; declared Medora. &ldquo;Already I feel
as properly married to you as I can be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But he soared to no such imaginative heights.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Marriage is marriage,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;We must
possess our souls in patience.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He spoke as though he were not going to find this difficult.
Indeed he was nervous and anxious to have certain
preliminaries completed. At the &ldquo;Edgeware Arms&rdquo; Kellock
asked for two bedrooms with a firm voice and registered
their names as &ldquo;Mr. and Mrs. Jordan Kellock, from
Totnes, Devonshire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They went upstairs together, led by a boy who carried
Medora&rsquo;s travelling basket and the man&rsquo;s leather portmanteau.
The bedrooms adjoined and Kellock invited
Medora to choose her room. He then left her luggage
there and went into the other himself.</p>

<p>She unpacked with some emotion and wondered when he
would come in to see her; but he did not come. She put on
a pair of shoes and a white blouse. She washed and did
her hair again, for it was untidy. Then she sat down to
wait. Presently he knocked at the outer door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you coming to supper?&rdquo; he asked, and she rose
and joined him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you rested? I&rsquo;m afraid you must be sinking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m quite all right. Is your room nice?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very comfortable. You don&rsquo;t mind them adjoining?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why should I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s certainly no reason,&rdquo; he admitted.</p>

<p>They supped together cheerfully and he made her drink
hot soup. He was a teetotaller but Medora asked for
some beer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dare say I&rsquo;ll get used to giving it up soon,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;In fact I mean to. Where I can be like you, Jordan, I
shall be. But I&rsquo;m used to a glass for supper and I&rsquo;m
extra tired to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He ordered a small bottle of Bass and under the stimu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>lant
she grew happy and confidential. She talked a great
deal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think I should have been able to eat a bit,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;but I never enjoyed a meal more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor me,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;When you&rsquo;ve done, we&rsquo;ll go
and sit in the writing room. That&rsquo;ll be empty, and we
can chat. But I know you&rsquo;re dog-tired, so I shan&rsquo;t let
you stop up long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The smoking room looked more attractive to Medora.
There was a haze in the air and a tang of cigar about
the portal. A chink of glass and sound of laughter might
be heard there. She would have liked to be seen sitting
by Mr. Kellock in some comfortable corner, while he too
smoked a cigar and drank some whiskey and soda perhaps,
or one of the bright drinks in very little glasses.
But she blamed herself for the wish. There must be no
small fancies of this sort. Her triumph would never be
displayed in public smoking rooms. She must realise
that from the first. As though to mark the austere
heights on which henceforth she would move, Jordan led
the way to an empty writing room silent and dark. A
decayed fire was perishing in the grate. He fumbled for
an electric light and turned it on. Then he shut the door
and drew an arm chair to the remains of the fire for her.
He took a light chair and placed it opposite her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here we can talk in private,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>She looked at a sofa, but he failed to perceive her
glance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; he told her, &ldquo;I begin the day by writing
to Mr. Trenchard and your husband.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t call him that any more. You&rsquo;ll
be telling me I&rsquo;m Mrs. Dingle in a minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As a matter of fact you are, Medora. We mustn&rsquo;t
dream beautiful dreams yet. We&rsquo;ve got to face reality
till we alter reality.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My life&rsquo;s not been reality so far&mdash;only a nightmare.&rdquo;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>&ldquo;Reality is nothing more than a question of time now.
In fact you may say it&rsquo;s begun, Medora.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed, Jordan dear. You can&rsquo;t guess what
heaven it is to me to know I&rsquo;m in your strong hands. I&rsquo;ve
come to rest after being tossed by cruel storms&mdash;to rest
in your arms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope I&rsquo;ll prove all you think me. I want to have
the future clear and the past off our minds; and then
we&rsquo;ll just enjoy ourselves and have a bit of good fun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She wondered what his idea of good fun would be. But
she was not yet feeling much like fun. While the evening
wore on and the fire went out and Kellock&rsquo;s level voice
proceeded to indicate the future as he hoped and desired
it to be, she began to feel cold and depressed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall inform Mr. Trenchard that I will return, or
leave as he prefers. It really doesn&rsquo;t matter to me; because,
thank God, my ability makes me independent. Of
course if you don&rsquo;t want to go back, I shouldn&rsquo;t think of
doing so; but you do want to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I want to. I like the country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will mean that your&mdash;that Mr. Dingle leaves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So he should; but he&rsquo;s just the man not to see it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Obviously he must leave, or I must. I bear him a
very bitter grudge for his cruelty to you, and I&rsquo;m not
going to pretend that I care about his future.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should hope not, Jordan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Far from it. Wrong done to you was wrong done to
me. At least that is what it amounts to now. My feeling
to Dingle will be the feeling of the strong to the weak,
Medora. He must go if you wish to stop. Of course
I&rsquo;ve got very different ideas from him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should hope you had.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For instance, I wouldn&rsquo;t let my wife work as he let
you work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She yawned presently and he exclaimed that he must
not keep her up any longer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You put everything out of your mind and go to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
bed,&rdquo; he advised. &ldquo;Would you like a cup of tea or anything
before you go?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not if you wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>But he explained that he never took anything after
his supper, and that the lighter his last meal, the better
he slept.</p>

<p>So she left him. He clasped her right hand in both his
and shook it affectionately for some seconds; but he did
not kiss her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall turn in pretty soon myself,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But
it&rsquo;s not above ten o&rsquo;clock yet. I&rsquo;ll stop here and draft
out those letters&mdash;that&rsquo;ll save time to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She went upstairs and presently, for curiosity, tried the
door between her room and his. It was open and she went
in. Through a Venetian blind slants of electric light from
the street illuminated the chamber; but that did not
show enough, so Medora turned on the light and looked for
evidence of Jordan. They were starkly simple: a brush
and comb on the dressing table, a shaving brush and a
tooth brush and a nail brush and sponge on the washing-stand.
Upon his bed lay a night shirt and against the
door hung his overcoat and black squash hat and dark
blue silk neckerchief. A few newspapers and books on
economic and industrial subjects he had also brought.
In a drawer of a chest of drawers were some collars and
socks and two blue flannel shirts.</p>

<p>What Medora expected to see she did not know, but
what she did see depressed her. She put out the light
and went back to her own room. Then all manners of
doubts and wonders occupied her mind and her first purpose
was to undress and get into bed as fast as possible
before the man came upstairs. She hesitated about locking
the door between them and decided to do so. His
importunities would be rather delightful and human. For
she felt that the humanity of Jordan was what she hungered
and thirsted for. She adored his chivalry and wonderful
tenderness and forethought; she perceived what a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
white knight he was&mdash;all these manifestations were duly
recorded and valued. But now&mdash;surely it was her turn
to reward a spirit so rare and worthy of reward?</p>

<p>She was soon in bed with her light out; and presently
she heard him arrive and saw a streak of illumination beneath
the intervening door. She listened and heard him
take off his boots and put them outside his door. But at
last he flicked off his light and pulled up the Venetian
blind. She remembered that he had told her he always
slept with his blind up.</p>

<p>Her heart beat hard now and her ears strained for the
next sound. It was not, however, the door-handle that
creaked, but Kellock&rsquo;s bed. There was a squeak and jolt
followed by silence.</p>

<p>The unwonted noise of the streets kept Medora awake
and she became the prey of thoughts that grew more and
more unpleasant. A brief peace sank over London, but
bells beating the hour would not let her sleep. During
the small hours and with vitality at low ebb, her mind
sank into a region of nervous gloom. For the moment
her triumph became divested of all its brilliance and there
was thrust upon her very forcibly the other aspect of such
action as she had taken. She considered her mother and
Ned. For some reason, and not a little to her annoyance,
thought took the bit in its teeth respecting Ned and absolutely
refused to dwell on the black side of him. As a
matter of fact Medora proved too weary to pretend any
longer. She was now disarmed; the sleight of her own
creation, which had risen as a sort of shield between her
and reality, for the present fell; and she found that her
reflections obstinately refused to follow the line she had
of late persisted in. The mind that she had drilled to
think as she wished, for once in a way threw off allegiance
and refused to be loyal to Medora&rsquo;s impersonation. Instead
it stumbled painfully but with determination along
the way of truth and reduced her to despair by persistently
bringing before her vision pictures of good days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
with Ned and memories from the past wherein he figured
to advantage.</p>

<p>She tossed and turned, grew very sorry for herself and
finally centred her thoughts on Kellock. She considered
his chaste attitude to the present situation rather absurd.
Then she fell to wondering whether this delicate matter
did not more properly belong to her. He was so high-minded
where she was concerned&mdash;a miracle of tender
refinement. For a long time she resisted an inclination to
go to him, but presently persuaded herself that it would
be the truest kindness to do so. Her own nature prompted
her strongly to seek comfort from him, for she was exceedingly
miserable now and awake with a hateful alertness.
She thought it was more than probable that he lay
on the other side of the wall similarly enduring. Surely
if she went to him, an everlasting bond would be established
between them and their union sealed gloriously by her
initiative. He was just that subtle man to appreciate
such an evidence of her perfect trust. Still some voice
in her argued contrariwise and not until a clock chimed
three did Medora decide. Then she made a dash for
him.</p>

<p>She unlocked the door between their rooms, opened it
gently and found Kellock lying peacefully asleep with the
wan light from his bared window irradiating the chamber.
The window was open and the room felt exceedingly cold.
She had not wakened him and for a moment she hesitated
and even went so far as to creep half-way back to the
door.</p>

<p>He looked very pale and very handsome asleep. He
slumbered easily with a pleasant, happy expression upon
his face. She fastened upon it and told herself that he
was glad to have won her and more than strong enough
to keep her for ever. She longed to be close to him and
feel his arms round her. A man so strong and physically
splendid could not lack for fire. It only awaited Medora&rsquo;s
awakening, and she was in a mood to wake it. If she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
to sleep at all that night, she must sleep with him, she
told herself.</p>

<p>Perhaps even now a whisper warned her; but she was
beyond warning. She wanted him and bent down and
kissed him on the mouth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My darling dear, I can&rsquo;t sleep alone,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you come to me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He started up instantly, and she saw him break from
sleep to waking and stare with half-seeing eyes as round
as an owl&rsquo;s. He grew exceedingly white and his jaw fell.
From an expression of content and peace, his countenance
became miserable and rather idiotic. It is not too much
to say that as soon as he found himself awake with Medora
in her nightdress beside him, he grew frightened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good God&mdash;what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; he asked in a hollow
voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the matter,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t be martyred
all night. I want to come and sleep beside you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then his face grew suddenly red with a wave of blood
and he was as wide awake as Medora herself.</p>

<p>He did not mince his words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go back to bed, Medora, at once! You don&rsquo;t know
what you&rsquo;re doing. You&rsquo;re dreaming&mdash;sleep-walking&mdash;surely.
You mean it innocently. I&rsquo;ll explain in the morning.
Please, please go&mdash;instantly, Medora.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She stared at him, stood upright and did not immediately
obey his command to depart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to look back at this great thing we
have done and feel any shadow upon it,&rdquo; he declared.
&ldquo;We want to be able to look into each other&rsquo;s faces and
know that we have nothing whatever, before God or man,
to reproach ourselves with. We&rsquo;ve started on the highest
plane and we&rsquo;ll keep on the highest plane. You understand
me. Indeed the beautiful thing has always been
that we do understand each other so perfectly. So&mdash;please,
Medora.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She did not answer, but obeyed. Burning and shaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
to her very bones she vanished and slammed the door
behind her; then she leapt into her bed and huddled under
the clothes in a fury. But she did not hate herself long;
she hated Kellock. It took Medora till five o&rsquo;clock in the
morning to cool down. An incident contributed to return
of calm, because, after she had left him, the man turned
on his electric light&mdash;she saw it under the door. And
apparently he kept it on. She could also hear him walking
about. It was clear therefore that she had disturbed
him a good deal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder he didn&rsquo;t turn over and go to sleep again,&rdquo;
she reflected bitterly.</p>

<p>It was long before she forgave him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even if he didn&rsquo;t want me, he oughtn&rsquo;t to have said
so,&rdquo; reflected Medora. &ldquo;He ought to have pretended
he was glad. To send me away like a naughty school
child after all I&rsquo;ve done for him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She determined that he must be punished and decided
that she would not get up at all next day, but stop in her
room and pretend to be ill. And in a thousand other ways
she would punish him also. He should see that she could
be as frosty as he. Indeed he had frozen her effectually
now. And she told herself that it would be a very long
time before she thawed again.</p>

<p>She slept heavily at last, and when she was called, found
that her will to hit back had weakened. By daylight she
perceived that nothing was to be gained in quarrelling
with Jordan. He had said that he would explain in the
morning and she felt it would be better to hear him. She
smouldered still and resented her experience extremely;
but she was ready when he knocked at her door and they
went down to breakfast together.</p>

<small>IN LONDON</small></h2></div>


<p>Jordan Kellock made no allusion whatever to Medora&rsquo;s
nocturnal aberration as they ate together, but directed her
as to his taste in tea and was very anxious to know her own
likes and dislikes in matters of food.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll write final copies of my letters,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;then
we&rsquo;ll go out and get the ring.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Could it be possible, she wondered, that a ring made
any difference to his mind? It seemed too childish; yet
even the cleverest men retained a streak of the boy. It
was from the eternal boy, as exemplified in Ned, that she
had escaped. Was Kellock going to be boyish also? He
had never shown any sign of it.</p>

<p>She need not have feared.</p>

<p>He did not ask Medora to read the letters to Mr.
Trenchard and Ned Dingle; but he had finished them and
posted them by ten o&rsquo;clock and then they set out.</p>

<p>He knew London and took Medora to the British
Museum first. She had waited for him to speak about the
previous night, while he, apparently, expected her to do
so. She had changed her views as to his punishment and
believed that she had quite forgiven him. But this was
not the case and before the end of the day he found it out.</p>

<p>At the Museum he surprised her by the extent of his
knowledge. She had heard enough by the time they went
to lunch and better liked the Park, where they sat for a
while in the afternoon. Medora saw wealth and beauty
and power pass by while Kellock commented.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the sort of thing we&rsquo;re out to alter,&rdquo; he said.
But she was not feeling in a socialistic mood.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t there be beautiful
horses and beautiful clothes in the world?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t the horses and clothes. It&rsquo;s where they come
from, Medora. The horses are bred for money, and the
clothes are spun and made for money. But who makes
the money? Do the people that ride the horses and wear
the clothes make it? No&mdash;you and I make it. The
workers make it. You and I have just as much right to
ride in a carriage as the Queen of England.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The wealth of the world is exploited,&rdquo; he explained,
&ldquo;and the result is poverty and superfluity. The world
could get on perfectly well without those horses and those
clothes&mdash;yes, and those people; but it couldn&rsquo;t get on
without us. We&rsquo;re carrying on the work of civilisation,
not those dolls and puppets toying together. Poverty and
wealth are the result of the same vicious factor in our
social system. They are interdependent and spring from
the same rotten roots. Banish poverty and you do away
with hunger and ignorance and misery and immorality and
other ills, all of which spring from it. And there&rsquo;s only
one way to banish poverty, and that&rsquo;s to banish wealth.
Then you get a self-respecting order of humanity instead
of the present arrangement. If the nation&rsquo;s rich, the people
are rich. It all comes back to brain power, and the moment
labour is strong enough in brain power, the rest follows.
The Trade Unions are only a first little instalment. In fact
they&rsquo;re almost past their work now. We&rsquo;ve gone beyond
them. Syndicalism says good-bye to the poor and good-bye
to the rich. Then we shall get face to face with reality.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what becomes of all these handsome, dashing,
prosperous people then?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing worse than what becomes of us. They will
be left with a great deal more than they deserve, because
they&rsquo;ve never lifted their fingers to help the real good of
the world. The revolution in this country, when it comes,
will be bloodless&mdash;merely a readjustment in conformity
with reason and justice. We&rsquo;re out against the system,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
not against the individual which battens on it. When we
make war on rats and sparrows and wood pigeons, we&rsquo;re
not quarrelling with the individual rat or sparrow, but
against the class. They&rsquo;ve got to go, because they&rsquo;re unsocial
and harm the community and take for themselves
what was grown and garnered for their betters. And
that&rsquo;s what the classes are doing. They take for themselves
what was earned by their betters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why are we their betters?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because we justify our existence and they do not.
Our lives are a round of work; their lives are a round of
luxury and pleasure. We earn the money and they spend
it. We save and they waste. Do they spend it on the
community? No. They spend it on themselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re taxed and all that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So are we. And taxing is a wrong system anyway.
All sources of wealth ought to pour straight into the State
and return to everybody in the shape of dignified conditions
of life. Money is the source of all evil to people and
it ought not to be handled by people, but by the State. If
you once knock the idea of money out of the human mind
and teach it to think in different values and occupy itself,
not with mean necessities and still meaner luxuries and possessions,
but the things of the soul&mdash;then you get on a
higher plane at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But she was more interested in things as they were. A
man or two obviously admired her, and the fact that she
sat beside Kellock did not seem to prevent their open admiration.
This cheered her and put her into good spirits.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How cheeky the gentlemen are,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They
don&rsquo;t seem to have any manners at all. They look at you
that bold, as if they&rsquo;d known you all their lives.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because they&rsquo;re rich and know that money is power.
These silk-hatted brutes have got nothing better to do
than to make eyes at every pretty woman they pass.
Many of them have never done a stroke of honest work in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
their lives, and never intend to. They are lower than the
tom cats and yet&mdash;that&rsquo;s the amazing thing&mdash;satisfied
with themselves&mdash;pleased with themselves&mdash;and treated
as decent members of society by the trash like them. I&rsquo;d
have them breaking stones if I could, instead of insulting
women with their goggling eyes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dare say some of them are dukes and earls, if we only
knew it,&rdquo; said Medora.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very likely indeed,&rdquo; he admitted; &ldquo;they&rsquo;re pretty
much what you&rsquo;d expect dukes and earls to be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But even Medora felt this was crude.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s plenty of good men among the Upper Ten,&rdquo;
she assured him. &ldquo;You think if a chap isn&rsquo;t born in the
gutter, he can&rsquo;t be any good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was the first of a succession of little snubs; though
Jordan hardly felt them at the time. But looking back
afterwards, he realised that Medora had her opinions and
that, apparently, they did not always echo his own.</p>

<p>He invited her to end the day where she pleased, and she
chose a music hall.</p>

<p>Here he was obviously and painfully ill at ease; and he
was also surprised to see the extent of Medora&rsquo;s enjoyment.
He felt absolute astonishment to hear her laugh so
heartily at comic songs on the old familiar lines, and still
more amazed that sentimental ditties of the most puling
description should have power to move her. She, for her
part, could not fail to see that the entertainment cast him
down. Not an item of the programme appealed to him
and the smoke made him cough.</p>

<p>As they came out, he hoped she had enjoyed it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How could I with you so glum?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t glum. That sort of thing rather misses me&mdash;that&rsquo;s
all. I&rsquo;ve not got the bent of mind for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so clever, you never see anything to make you
wonder, and so wise, you never see anything to make you
laugh,&rdquo; she said.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>His eyes grew rather round, but Medora was smiling
and had not meant the speech to be acerb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see plenty to make me wonder in London. Who
doesn&rsquo;t? And I like a good joke; but these stage people
didn&rsquo;t seem funny to me. And honestly, the longer I live,
the less I see to laugh at in the world, for a thinking man
with high resolves to better things. People laugh for two
reasons, I believe: to throw their neighbours off the scent
of the truth; or else because they are rattle-pated, light-minded
fools, with no more in them than an empty pot.
The &lsquo;empties&rsquo; make the most noise, don&rsquo;t they? All the
same, I like to hear you laugh, because you laugh honest
and it means you&rsquo;re happy. And God knows if there&rsquo;s one
thing I want to make happy before everybody on earth,
it&rsquo;s you, Medora.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She relented before this speech and took his arm. He
was gallant and very jealous for her. He was also very
tender and gentle. She acknowledged his consideration as
they sat at supper; but he spoiled all by explaining the
very special reason for his care and attention.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The position is a most delicate one,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and
naturally I must do nothing to make it more so. You&rsquo;re
at the mercy of the world now, in a manner of speaking,
Medora&mdash;a defenceless creature&mdash;not maid, wife or
widow, as they say. And so it&rsquo;s up to me to be extra
awake and very quick to champion you in every way I can
think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Medora felt that if this were indeed the case, Jordan and
not she might be said to stand in the limelight. She, in
fact, must remain as much in the shade as possible. But
he proceeded and explained his future course of action.
It surprised her exceedingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Talking of that and all I owe you for coming to me,
you may be sure I shall pay the debt in a proper manner,
Medora. I honour you far too much to treat you with
anything but the greatest respect and delicacy, I hope;
and I certainly would demean myself, or you, to live with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
you as a husband till we&rsquo;re married. But let the world
think as it pleases&mdash;which is mostly evil&mdash;we shall know
what we really are, and we&rsquo;ll always be&mdash;a self-respecting,
high-minded pair. It&rsquo;s easy enough to be better
than the world thinks you, because it judges others by itself
and the mass of people have a very base standard.
The law itself is disgusting and bestial in this matter. It
sticks to the old, shameful conditions and demands adultery
before divorce. So there must be evidence of that&mdash;we&rsquo;re
ordered to sink to furnishing evidence of it; but we&rsquo;re
made of much too fine stuff to sink to the heathen reality.
We&rsquo;re a cut above the dirty law&mdash;you and me. We want
to live our future lives on a plane of mutual respect and
admiration. We don&rsquo;t mean all the future to be spoiled
by the memory of human weakness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He made no other allusion to the previous night and
Medora&rsquo;s wonderful eyes bent upon him with apparent
adoration, while her wonderful heart grew a little hard.
She remembered that she had been married and he never
had.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a saint,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no&mdash;only a clean-minded, honourable man, Medora.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She fell asleep gently hating him that night; but after
many hours of dreamless slumber, she awoke in better
spirits and found herself loving Kellock again. He was a
hero and somewhat abnormal, as heroes must be; but, after
all, she was a heroine, and should therefore find no supreme
difficulty in rising to the heights on which he moved. She
saw indeed that this would be necessary if she wished to be
happy.</p>

<p>She met him radiantly next morning and he found her
mood easy and humble. He knew a man at Doulton&rsquo;s Pottery,
and when he suggested going to see the famous works,
she agreed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall be among our own sort there,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It
will be good for us. I don&rsquo;t think sitting in Hyde Park<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
watching the rich was good for us. I may have said a bit
more than I meant about them. They&rsquo;re not all worthless
wasters, of course, and it&rsquo;s quite true what you said, that
there may be a bit of class prejudice in me.&rdquo; </p>

<p>&ldquo;No, there isn&rsquo;t&mdash;not a scrap,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;And
if there is, they deserve it. Nobody looks all round things
like you do. You&rsquo;ll live to see it all altered no doubt, and
do your bit to help alter it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I had my way, them that don&rsquo;t work shouldn&rsquo;t eat,&rdquo;
he declared. &ldquo;Work&rsquo;s the saving of mankind, and you
can&rsquo;t be healthy-minded if you sit and look on at life, any
more than you can be healthy-bodied if you take no exercise.
We all owe a lot to every one else, and them that
won&rsquo;t pay that debt and want to take all and give nought,
are wicked enemies to the State.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At Doulton&rsquo;s Medora was genuinely interested, and best
she liked the painting rooms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s beautiful work,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If I&rsquo;d been
brought up to that, I&rsquo;d have joyed in it, because there&rsquo;s
something to show for it, and you&rsquo;d know the flowers and
ribbons you painted was brightening up other people&rsquo;s
homes. But my work&mdash;just shifting paper and putting
the zinc between the sheets for the glazing rollers&mdash;there&rsquo;s
nothing to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you say that. All necessary work is fine if it&rsquo;s
done well, same as you did it. But there&rsquo;ll be no more of
that sort of work for you. Your place will be at home;
and I shouldn&rsquo;t be content for you just to do housewife&rsquo;s
work neither, Medora. You&rsquo;re going to be my right hand
and look after my papers and help me with the big things
I hope to do&mdash;not in the Mill, but out of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never shall be clever enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you will. You&rsquo;ll come to it when you get a grasp
of all the questions we&rsquo;re out to solve. You&rsquo;ll begin at the
beginning, where I did, and master the theory of socialism&mdash;the
theories I should say, because it&rsquo;s a science
that&rsquo;s in the making and clever men are still working out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
the details. There&rsquo;s a lot of difference of opinion, and so
far as I can see, our leaders&mdash;the &lsquo;intellectuals,&rsquo; as they
are called&mdash;don&rsquo;t see eye to eye by any means yet.
They&rsquo;re all for universal democracy, of course, and the
government of the people by the people and the redistribution
of wealth and the uplift of the worker and so on; but
they differ as to how it&rsquo;s to be done and how the mass is
to be brought out of slavery to the promised land. In
fact no two of &rsquo;em think the same, strange to say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a big subject,&rdquo; said Medora blankly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the only subject.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I lay you&rsquo;ve thought it all out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got my ideas, and in our evenings I shall put &rsquo;em
before you and read you a lot I&rsquo;ve written about it. We&rsquo;ll
go over it together, and you&rsquo;ll bring your own wits to
work on it when you&rsquo;ve mastered all the different opinions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I was half as clever as you think,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what you can do till you try. The
first thing is to get interested in it and let it soak into
you. Once you feel like I do, that it is the only thing
that really matters for the race, then you&rsquo;ll properly live
for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I expect I shall,&rdquo; replied Medora, with a fainting soul.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s noble women giving up their lives to it, and I
hope you&rsquo;ll be one of them some day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She began to experience the discomfort of the mountain
climber, who ascends into more rarefied air than he is accustomed
to breathe. It was not until she had enjoyed a good
lunch and a bottle of lemonade that Medora felt lighter-hearted.</p>

<p>They went to no more music halls, but Jordan took her
to a play of Shakespeare and a concert. They also visited
the Mint, the Tower of London and the Zoological Gardens.
At the last she was interested and happy. He improved
every occasion. On one afternoon they went to a
meeting of the Labour Party and heard great lights discuss
the Internationale. Kellock flamed with enthusiasm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
afterwards and talked ceaselessly till bed time. She had
never seen him so excited. She retired with a headache,
bewildered and bored to tears.</p>

<p>Of personal matters the only interest centred in a communication
from Mr. Trenchard. As for Dingle, he did
not answer Jordan&rsquo;s letter. Nor did he come to see Jordan,
as Medora half hoped he might. She trusted that
some emotional scenes were to occur in the future; but if
drama lay in store for her, it would doubtless be at Dene,
not in London.</p>

<p>She wrote to her mother justifying her conduct; but
Lydia did not reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lost mother,&rdquo; said Medora, after three days&rsquo; silence.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not going to answer that nice letter I
showed you. In fact I&rsquo;ve lost everybody but you. And
I&rsquo;d lose them all a hundred times over for you, Jordan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must be patient,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We know we&rsquo;re right,
and those that know they&rsquo;re right can afford to be patient.
The rest will be brought to see it in process of time. They
must be educated to the truth. Everything depends on
education, Medora. It works through everything&mdash;in
private affairs and public affairs alike. Ignorance makes
all the trouble in the world; and once the spread of education
brings the light, then we get a move on and see our
way clear. It is for you and me to show the people that we
are sure of ourselves and set them the example of how to
behave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll live it down,&rdquo; said Medora.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; we&rsquo;ve got nothing to live down,&rdquo; he declared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s for them to live down their ignorance of the case.
And it is for us to help them to do it and show them, day
by day, that we were right and they were wrong. But you
can&rsquo;t do big things without suffering big things. I warn
you there will be a lot at first who will side against us&mdash;the
sort that judge by the outside, as most do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dare say we&rsquo;ll be sent to Coventry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They may cabal against us like that. But the harder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
the opposition, the greater the triumph when we show them
what we are. We must look to each other for our comfort
and support and to our own hearts and good conscience.
I&rsquo;m not afraid for myself. A man can weather anything
if he knows he is right. But for a tender creature like
you, all full of nerves and that, it will be harder. But you
may trust me to be pretty wide awake on your behalf,
Medora. I&rsquo;ll be sleepless to shield you and come between
you and every hard word. I&rsquo;ll fight for you, I promise
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know that,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The pinch will be before
we&rsquo;re married. Afterwards they&rsquo;ll soon calm down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her affection and trust were unbounded. She believed
that he would fight for her, and she looked forward not a
little to seeing him do so.</p>

<p>Through the atmosphere of the Metropolis, the people
at Dene shrank a little. She was prepared to return with
a mind enlarged and a perspective widened. No doubt she
and Jordan would come to London themselves some day,
when he took his place among the leaders. But in the
meantime she would not for anything have missed the return
to her native village. Her new clothes alone must
have sufficed to dictate this step. He, too, at her wish,
had bought some new clothes, and though he hesitated at
her choice, which led to rather more radiant colours than
Kellock was wont to wear, yet he told himself, very truly,
that in such a matter no principle was involved. He also
felt that it became him to fall in with his future wife&rsquo;s
wishes when and where it was possible and reasonable to
do so.</p>

<p>They visited the Arts and Crafts Exhibition, where the
new Dene water-mark pictures created daily admiration,
completed their holiday and so returned; and their homecoming
was anticipated in various ways, showing, though
ignorance is the root of all evil, as Jordan never wearied
of declaring, that even ignorant hearts may soar to heights
of distinguished humanism.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br />

<small>THE DRYING LOFTS</small></h2></div>


<p>A dozen great piles of &ldquo;water leaf&rdquo; had come up from
the vat room to the hand presses, and here the paper,
from which tons of crystal water had already been expressed
below, under new and tremendous pressure yielded
still more. Indeed, with half a dozen men bearing on the
levers of the presses, the &ldquo;water leaf,&rdquo; that had appeared
so dry, beaded and glittered and then exuded further rivulets
of moisture. For the last turn of the screw a great
beam was thrust into the press and as many men as could
get purchase upon it lent their united strength. Ernest
Trood, passing through the pressing room, gave a hand,
and a stack of newly made paper was subjected to such
strain that one had thought it must disintegrate beneath it.</p>

<p>Here, under this tremendous impost, the grain mark, or
pattern imparted to each sheet by the felts at the first
pressing in the vat room, was removed.</p>

<p>For the drying lofts the paper was next destined and
hither Ernest Trood now found himself summoned by a
messenger. Mr. Trenchard desired to speak with him.</p>

<p>The drying lofts were enormous airy chambers that
ascended to an unceiled roof. Through the twilight gloom
of these apartments, the sheets of paper, large and small,
glimmered, hanging aloft in multi-coloured reams like fairy
washing; pink and blue, yellow and snow-white. The
paper seemed to make dim rainbows aloft, where it ascended
tier on tier in many thousands of separate pieces.
Every sheet was suspended over ropes, strung across
transverse beams on light scaffolding, that filled the lofts
and ascended into the dark dome of the roof. Above them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
spun drying fans, to expel the exhausted air and suck away
the moisture exuding from the masses of paper; while on
the floors beneath there wound and twisted an elaborate
system of hot-air pipes, which raised the temperature at
will.</p>

<p>Drying is a process that demands watchfulness and
judgment, for wet paper suspended here on the tackle does
not respond in all its parts simultaneously. From the
deckle edge it dries inward and the last spot to dry is the
centre of each sheet. The dry workers, with a hand-tool
like a T square, hang their sheets over the russet, cow-hair
ropes; then when the rope is loaded, pull it aloft; but the
art of drying lies in the regulation of heat and air. The
heat is great, yet regular; every operation is ordered for
cleanliness and purity, so that not a speck of dust may
fall to mar a sheet.</p>

<p>Here came Matthew Trenchard upon a question of temperature.
The talk concerned technical details of ventilation
and did not take long, since Trood and his master
seldom differed. But there was a more doubtful human
problem upon which Trenchard desired to learn Trood&rsquo;s
opinion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard from Kellock,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and before I answer
him, I want to hear you speak&mdash;also Pinhey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not likely that Nicholas Pinhey and me would say
the same,&rdquo; answered Ernest. &ldquo;We differ where we can
on most subjects, and shall on this, I reckon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t influence me&mdash;more will you,&rdquo; answered
Trenchard. &ldquo;You and I will probably think alike, as
we&rsquo;re used to do. What I want from Nicholas has to do
with Mrs. Dingle, who works in the glazing house&mdash;or
did. Let&rsquo;s go into the flat room and I&rsquo;ll send for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The flat room was another chamber for paper drying.
Hither came the great sheets of &ldquo;double elephant&rdquo; and
&ldquo;imperial&rdquo;&mdash;precious and wonderful papers for the
artist and draughtsman, that could not be hung over a
rope or creased. They rested upon beds of webbing, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
were lifted one above the other and offered free access to
the warm air that plied through them. Here dried noble
sheets of a quality that rejoiced the painter who touched
their surface, and felt their solid texture.</p>

<p>Nicholas Pinhey, spotless and trim, with shining spectacles
and a white apron, appeared and Mr. Trenchard
briefly stated the situation. He was carrying a &ldquo;cross,&rdquo;
the little tool used to hang the paper on the lines, and he
tapped his points against the wall of the flat room as he
uttered them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems Kellock, who is on holiday, has run away with
Mrs. Dingle. I&rsquo;ve just heard from him stating the facts
as far as they may be supposed to concern me. He doesn&rsquo;t
seem to think it is anybody&rsquo;s business but his own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A man may be ill and not know it,&rdquo; said Mr. Pinhey,
&ldquo;and he may be suffering from the sickness of sin and not
know it. But we know it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a sin-doctor&mdash;I&rsquo;m a paper maker, Nicholas.
And the sole question for me is whether Kellock comes
back, or does not. He writes very decently, says he is
prepared to justify his conduct if I feel it is any concern
of mine, and adds that he will be well pleased to return
if I want him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let him slip, for the Lord&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; begged Ernest
Trood. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll wait a month of Sundays before you&rsquo;ll
get another vatman in the same street as him. Vatmen
will be as rare as curates very soon. He&rsquo;s a most orderly
chap and a rare worker, which the clever ones often are
not, and a great believer in discipline. You may be sure,
according to his lights, that he&rsquo;s done the best for all
parties in this matter of Medora Dingle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can you, Trood?&rdquo; asked Mr. Pinhey indignantly.
&ldquo;And you call yourself a Christian man, for I&rsquo;ve heard you
do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The mistake you make, Nicholas, is to drag religion
into a lot of things where it don&rsquo;t belong,&rdquo; answered Trood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing where religion don&rsquo;t belong,&rdquo; declared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
the finisher, &ldquo;and if that was understood and religion applied
to every problem of living and working and dying,
this world would be different from what it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The question is, of course, Ned Dingle,&rdquo; explained
Trenchard. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to back up one man against
the other or interfere in any way over their domestic affairs.
I&rsquo;m not here to probe and pry, but to make paper
along with the rest of you. Both Ned and Jordan are
very good fellows; but it&rsquo;s quite clear they won&rsquo;t see alike
in this matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be too sure,&rdquo; advised Mr. Trood. &ldquo;Least said
soonest mended, and for all anybody can swear to the contrary
it may be a put-up thing. Of course Ned would
have to pretend a lot of temper in that case&mdash;to blind
the public eye; because if it got out that Kellock had
agreed to take over his wife for the better happiness and
understanding of all parties, the Law would step in very
quick and queer their pitch. If these things were settled
by common sense, the Law would lose money&mdash;the last
thing it ever loses. But it may be like that&mdash;Kellock
being such a shrewd and long-sighted man. So I should
just keep Jordan and let Dingle say what he&rsquo;s going to
do. Ned&rsquo;s not showing more feeling, so far, than the case
demands. He may be thanking God in secret and be quite
as religious-minded as Nicholas could wish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s generally known of course,&rdquo; said Trenchard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Such things can&rsquo;t be hid and didn&rsquo;t ought to be,&rdquo; replied
Mr. Pinhey. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re a very high-toned lot here
for the most part, and me and Trood have something to
do with that I believe; and I should be very sorry if he
was to pander to evil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nobody&rsquo;s pandering to evil, Nicholas,&rdquo; explained Matthew
Trenchard. &ldquo;But business is business and will continue
to be so. I don&rsquo;t lose Kellock if I can help it; but
Dingle&rsquo;s a very good man, too, and I wish to consider
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dingle&rsquo;s nothing to Kellock,&rdquo; asserted Trood; &ldquo;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
I shouldn&rsquo;t for an instant say Kellock was all wrong and
Dingle all right. Women don&rsquo;t run away from their husbands
for nothing. I believe Ned&rsquo;s been knocking her
about, and she was divided between them in the past, and
now, finding she backed the wrong one, she&rsquo;s gone over to
the other. It seems to be a private affair in my opinion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sin&rsquo;s never a private affair. It&rsquo;s everybody&rsquo;s affair
and ought to be everybody&rsquo;s enemy,&rdquo; said Pinhey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then let nature take its course,&rdquo; suggested Ernest
Trood. &ldquo;Let Dingle divorce her in a respectable way,
and let us spare their feelings all we can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Obviously they can&rsquo;t both stop here after this,&rdquo; observed
Trenchard, &ldquo;and if Kellock comes back, Dingle will
go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be putting a premium on vice if you agree to
that, Mr. Trenchard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no vice in it, Nicholas,&rdquo; answered Trood.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like an old woman to talk that way. You know very
well indeed that Jordan Kellock&rsquo;s not a vicious person.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know very well he is, then. And them as don&rsquo;t go
to church, or chapel, like him, have nothing to stand between
them and temptation. And this is the result.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trenchard laughed at Pinhey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where the shoe pinches&mdash;eh, Nicholas? But
we mustn&rsquo;t be narrow-minded because we live in a narrow
valley. That&rsquo;s what I tell others besides you. Kellock
is a man of high feelings and great ideals. I don&rsquo;t agree
with much that he dreams; but I know this: that the
dreamer who makes his dreams come true is the salt of
the earth. He&rsquo;s very young and he&rsquo;s got a mighty lot
to learn&mdash;and he&rsquo;ll learn it. Whether he has the brains
to go far I can&rsquo;t say, but at present he&rsquo;s very valuable
to me and as he&rsquo;s willing to come back, I take him back.
As for Ned, I shall see him to-day and hear all that he
cares to tell me. I&rsquo;m heartily sorry for his troubles; but
he&rsquo;s a sane sort of chap, too, and no doubt has come to
some conclusion about the future.&rdquo;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>&ldquo;That only leaves the woman then,&rdquo; said Trood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll go in any case,&rdquo; declared the master.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t answer for the glazing room if she don&rsquo;t,&rdquo;
promised Mr. Pinhey. &ldquo;In a manner of speaking, after
five-and-twenty years there, I may be said to set the tone
of the glazing room, Mr. Trenchard, and if she were to
come into it again and take her place at the crib, the other
women, if I know &rsquo;em, would rise up and depart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not them, Nicholas. You don&rsquo;t know women if you
think that. Women don&rsquo;t cut off their noses to spite their
faces in my experience.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t touch pitch and not be defiled, Ernest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who wants to touch pitch? The girl ain&rsquo;t pitch; and
if she were, she&rsquo;s not the sort to influence anybody. Just
a silly, everyday, selfish creature, vain of her good looks
and with no more sense than, please God, she should have.
The mystery is that Lydia Trivett, who&rsquo;s made of sense,
should have put none into her child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll go as a matter of course,&rdquo; repeated Matthew
Trenchard. &ldquo;Her own feeling would decide that question.
I hate interfering with anybody here, Pinhey, and
because a great many of you pay me the compliment to
consult me about your private affairs, that&rsquo;s no reason
why I should ever go into them on my own account.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But when those that work under you do wrong, then,
as their employer and leader, I submit in all civility it&rsquo;s
up to you to learn them right,&rdquo; argued Nicholas. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
putting a bonus on sin if Kellock stops here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trood snorted and called Pinhey a fool; but Trenchard
spoke gently to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I admire your clean and resolute religious views of
life, if I don&rsquo;t always share them,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;but
we mustn&rsquo;t be self-righteous, Nick, and we mustn&rsquo;t think
our own standard of conduct covers all the ground. You
wait till we know more about it. Sin&rsquo;s like conscience, a
matter of education, Nicholas, and what&rsquo;s sin in one man
is no sin at all in another. We mustn&rsquo;t fling the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
stone too readily, because few of us have got the judicial
mind, or the impartial and unprejudiced outlook, or the
knowledge of the facts that belong, or ought to belong,
to the judgment seat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can all read the Scriptures,&rdquo; answered Mr. Pinhey
firmly, &ldquo;and if our judgment is founded on the Word, Mr.
Trenchard, it is founded on the Rock of Ages, with Whom
is no shadow of turning. And I don&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;ll stop under
the same roof as an adulterer, I don&rsquo;t indeed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do your duty, Nicholas; I&rsquo;m sure of that,&rdquo; answered
the other, and Pinhey, sighing profoundly, went
his way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no fool like a pious fool,&rdquo; said Trood scornfully,
&ldquo;and I hope to Heaven you&rsquo;ll let Kellock stop.
Beatermen, like Dingle, are got again, but such vatmen
as Jordan Kellock are not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know that mighty well, Ernest, and just for that
reason we must look sharp into it and not let self-interest
bend us into anything wrong. With some men I&rsquo;d fire
them on a job like this and have no more words about
it; but Kellock&rsquo;s different. He&rsquo;s honourable, so far as
my experience goes, and scrupulous in small things&mdash;a
straight man every way. He has himself well in hand
and he&rsquo;s got ambitions. He would hardly have done such
a grave thing as this on foolish impulse. But I don&rsquo;t want
to be prejudiced for him any more than against him. I&rsquo;ll
leave it till I&rsquo;ve heard Ned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t you let Dingle turn you from him,&rdquo; begged
Ernest. &ldquo;It stands to reason that Dingle won&rsquo;t have
much good to say of him. Whatever he feels in secret,
he must curse Kellock openly. In my opinion you ought
to hear Kellock also on his own defence, before you sack
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I ought; and perhaps I will,&rdquo; answered the
other. &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t lose Kellock if it&rsquo;s in right and reason to
keep him. Send Ned to me after dinner at one o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br />

<small>GOING UP CORKSCREW HILL</small></h2></div>


<p>Below Bow Bridge a row of narrow-headed stepping-stones
are regularly placed across the river with their
noses pointing up stream. The current sets thin lines of
light trickling away, where the stones break its surface.
Above the crossing, trees overhang the water and throw
shadows to break the white sheen of stickles and the flash
of foam; beneath the stepping-stones the channel widens
and flows forward to the estuary. A dead tree had fallen
here and upon one bough, overhanging a still pool, sat a
kingfisher, like a spark of blue fire against the grey and
umber colours spread round him. Beyond, where the
stream bent eastward, there rose a fir-clad hill, and at
water&rsquo;s brink stood cottages with irregular thatched roofs.
Their white-washed faces represented the highest light of
the scene and were a centre and focus for that rural picture.</p>

<p>Beside the stepping-stones Ned Dingle sat and smoked
his pipe. The water at his feet had run fine after a spell
of dry weather, and there was only the motion of the lazy
stream, broken now and then by a small fish. White ducks
paddled close by in a shallow, where the afternoon sunshine
turned the water to liquid amber and made the birds
golden bright.</p>

<p>Ned thought of an autumn day, when he had landed not
far off with Kellock and Medora at the boathouse; and he
retraced all the months between. He was in melancholy
mood and as yet had not determined on his future actions;
but he had seen Matthew Trenchard, given notice and left
the Mill.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>The master was sympathetic and friendly. He accepted
the situation and on this Saturday, as Dingle
awaited others at the stepping-stones, the beaterman reflected
that his activities at Dene were ended. He was
now about to seek work elsewhere. On Monday, Kellock
would return, and Mrs. Trivett reported that Jordan had
already taken rooms for the present at &ldquo;The Waterman&rsquo;s
Arms,&rdquo; a little inn standing up the valley between Dene
and Ashprington, at Bow Bridge.</p>

<p>Dingle still failed to grasp the extent of the disaster
that had overtaken him. His moods alternated between
wrath and grief and bewilderment at his loss. Mrs. Trivett
supported him frankly and she introduced an element
of mystery into the scandal, for she continued to declare
it was not in Kellock&rsquo;s character to do this thing. Even
the fact that he had done it was powerless to alter her
reiterated assertion. She never greatly blamed Kellock,
even when others pointed out that men do not run away
with other men&rsquo;s wives on compulsion; and one fact she
never ceased to dwell upon, which comforted Dingle in a
negative sort of fashion.</p>

<p>She repeated her assurance this evening; for now there
came to Dingle, Lydia and the girl, Daisy Finch, Medora&rsquo;s
friend. They were at leisure, since the day was Saturday,
and they had joined him by appointment to fulfil a certain
task. Mrs. Trivett, unaware of Medora&rsquo;s sentiments on
the subject, had suggested that her daughter&rsquo;s things
should be moved from Ned&rsquo;s house and taken to &ldquo;The
Waterman&rsquo;s Arms,&rdquo; there to await her, and Ned agreed.
His purpose was to leave no trace of Medora in his house;
and soon there would be no trace of him either, for he was
about to seek work elsewhere and doubted not to find it.</p>

<p>As they ascended the hill to Ashprington, Lydia repeated
her assurance. She had good private reasons for
uttering more ferocious sentiments than perhaps she felt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be that he&rsquo;ll ever make her happy,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s out of that man&rsquo;s power to do it. And not only I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
say so, for Philander Knox, who is very understanding,
said so, last week without any promptings from me. He
said so from his knowledge of Kellock, while I say so from
my knowledge of my child. And so I tell you, Ned, as
I&rsquo;ve told you before, that you&rsquo;ll be very properly revenged,
without lifting your hand to anybody.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall do what I shall do,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t
know more than you what I shall do. I may take forty
shillings or a month out of the man yet. Some days I
feel like that; other days I do not. For all she&rsquo;s done I
know this: I understand your blasted daughter better
than ever Kellock will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Knox says they&rsquo;ll both get their punishment and
he hopes you&rsquo;ll let &rsquo;em be. And if you did, that would
be the worst punishment. In Philander&rsquo;s opinion there&rsquo;s
no call for anybody to interfere, because let &rsquo;em alone and
they&rsquo;ll punish each other to their dying day. That&rsquo;s the
terrible picture he paints of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never understand,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never know
what choked her off me. There must have been secret
enemies at work lying against me I reckon. But she could
never put a case against me worth its weight in words,
and to the last I didn&rsquo;t dream what she was up to. A base,
treacherous bit of play-acting I call it. And to crown all
by that beastly letter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you could believe in such things, I&rsquo;d say Medora
had the evil eye put upon her and was ill-wished into this,&rdquo;
said Daisy. &ldquo;Such a girl as she was&mdash;so happy, and
so fond of an outing, and so fond of cheerful company;
and used to be so fond of Ned, I&rsquo;m sure, for when you was
first married, she was always telling me how she cared for
you. Then the change came over her like bad weather.
What did Jordan Kellock say, Ned, if I may ask?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no secrets. The letter&rsquo;s like the man&mdash;cut
and dried. Nobody else on God&rsquo;s earth could have written
it I should think. He feels that Medora made a mistake,
but that it needn&rsquo;t be fatal to all three of us; and that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
as we all respect ourselves, and are responsible members
of society, we can put the mistake right in a reasonable
and dignified sort of way. Never a word of shame. He
seems to think he&rsquo;s only got to state the facts, as he sees
them, for me to fall in with them. He says, of course,
my first thought will be consideration for Medora, so that
her sensitive and delicate nature may be spared as much
as possible. He feels quite sure that he can leave the
subject in my hands, and assures me that he will do everything
possible to assist me. That&rsquo;s the divorce of course.
Medora wasn&rsquo;t so nice in her letter. She ordered me to
divorce her sharp. But even so, I&rsquo;d sooner have her insults
than his civility. Civility by God! From him.
She&rsquo;d worked herself up to a pitch of temper when she
wrote that trash, and let out the poison he&rsquo;s put into her
mind. She&rsquo;s a damned silly woman and that&rsquo;s all there
is to her; but faithless, worthless wretch that she is, I
can forgive her easier than him. I don&rsquo;t feel as if I wanted
to shoot her, or cut her throat, or anything like that. My
feeling to her is beyond my power to put into words at
present, though no doubt it will clear itself. But I see
him clear enough for a foul hypocrite&mdash;smug and sly
and heartless. He&rsquo;s played for his own hand for a year
and slowly worked her up to the outrage she&rsquo;s put on
me. In fact I don&rsquo;t see how I can very well help breaking
his neck, when it comes to the point.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t for me to stand up for him against you,&rdquo; admitted
Lydia. &ldquo;All the same, my instinct tells me to pray
you not to be rough, Ned. You&rsquo;ve got right on your side,
and it&rsquo;s easier in some ways to suffer wrong than commit
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Depends what you call wrong,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;If
Kellock thought it no wrong to kindiddle my wife away
from me, why should I think it wrong to get back a bit of
my own? Men have killed men for less than this, and a
jury of husbands have said they wasn&rsquo;t guilty. I may not
be the sort to kill anybody; but I&rsquo;ll let him that bleats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
such a lot about self-respect see I&rsquo;ve got my self-respect
as well as he has, and mean to act according. It&rsquo;s all in
the air&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know what I shall do. I&rsquo;ve got to make
him eat his self-respect somehow and show him what he is;
and that&rsquo;s a long way different from what he thinks he is.
I&rsquo;ll make &rsquo;em look a pair of fools sooner or later&mdash;if
no worse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you will then; and take it in a high spirit and do
nought to make yourself look a fool,&rdquo; urged Lydia; but he
declared that it was too late for that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I look a fool all right,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not such a
sand-blind sort of man that I don&rsquo;t know very well what
I look like. People always laugh at a chap in my fix.
Let &rsquo;em. Perhaps I shall laugh too presently. The difference
between me and that man is that I can stand a bit
of laughter; but he couldn&rsquo;t. Laughter would kill him.
He&rsquo;d stand up to blame and hard words and curses. He
likes &rsquo;em&mdash;he told me so&mdash;because it shows his ideas go
deep and fret people&rsquo;s accepted opinions. Every reformer
must make enemies, or he&rsquo;s not doing his job right&mdash;so
he said to Knox one day, and I heard him. But laughter
and scorn and contempt&mdash;that&rsquo;s different.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They reached Ned&rsquo;s house and, for his sake, set about
their painful task with resolution.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like as if we was going through a dead woman&rsquo;s
things,&rdquo; whispered Daisy to Mrs. Trivett and the elder
agreed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is dead as far as poor Ned&rsquo;s concerned,&rdquo; she answered.
&ldquo;And if anything on earth could shame her to
death, surely it will be to see all her clothes and everything
she&rsquo;s got in the world waiting for her when she
arrives.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Daisy, however, argued for her friend while they collected
her garments and tied them in brown paper parcels.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to say a word against Mr. Dingle, but
all the same no such dreadful thing could have happened
if he&rsquo;d been the right one. There&rsquo;s always two sides to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
every trouble and there must be excuses that we don&rsquo;t
know about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Trivett admitted this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s always excuses for everybody that we don&rsquo;t
know about, Daisy. We all do things we can&rsquo;t explain&mdash;good
as well as bad; and if we can&rsquo;t explain ourselves to
ourselves, then it&rsquo;s right and reasonable as we shouldn&rsquo;t
be too sure we can explain other people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They made parcels of everything that belonged to Medora,
then Ned brought to them a work-box, two pictures
in frames and a sewing-machine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These have all got to go also,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And this
lot you&rsquo;d better give her when you see her. It&rsquo;s her trinkrums
and brooches and such like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He gave Mrs. Trivett a little box which she put in her
pocket without speaking.</p>

<p>Another woman joined them. She was Ned&rsquo;s old aunt,
who had come to him to keep his house as long as he
should remain in it. She talked venomously of Medora.</p>

<p>Presently they carried the parcels down the lane to the
foot of the hill and left them at &ldquo;The Waterman&rsquo;s Arms,&rdquo;
in a little parlour on one side of the entrance. Then Ned
went home and Daisy Finch and Mrs. Trivett returned to
Dene. There the girl left Lydia, and the latter, after a
cup of tea with a neighbour, prepared to climb the Corkscrew
Hill and return to Cornworthy.</p>

<p>Then it was that she found a man waiting for her and
Philander Knox appeared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew your movements,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I knew that
you&rsquo;d be setting out for the farm just about now, so I
thought as I&rsquo;d keep you company up the hill. For I always
find, going up the Corkscrew, that it&rsquo;s easier travelled
in company.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was gratified.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a kind soul and I&rsquo;m very glad, if you&rsquo;ve got
nothing better to do. My thoughts ain&rsquo;t pleasant companions
to-night, Mr. Knox.&rdquo;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>&ldquo;They should be,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;for your thoughts
can&rsquo;t bully you, nor yet accuse you of things left undone,
or done ill, like most of us have got to suffer from them.
You can face your thoughts same as you can face your
deeds, with a good conscience all the time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who can? I can&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m cruel vexed now. That slip
of a child, Daisy Finch, have been showing me that I may
have been too hard on my own daughter. And yet&mdash;how
can one feel too hard? &rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t as if I didn&rsquo;t know Ned
Dingle. But I do. He&rsquo;s took this in a very Christian
spirit&mdash;so far. I&rsquo;d never have thought for a moment
he&rsquo;d have held in so well, or been such a gentleman over
it. Some people might almost think he didn&rsquo;t care and
didn&rsquo;t feel it; but he does&mdash;with all his heart he does.
He couldn&rsquo;t speak when I left him just now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true&mdash;he certainly does feel it properly. But
it&rsquo;s a very peculiar case, along of Kellock being the man
he is. I haven&rsquo;t got to the bottom of the thing yet. As
a rule I&rsquo;m not great on other people&rsquo;s business, as you
know, but in this case, along of my hopes where you&rsquo;re
concerned, Lydia, I take this to be a part of my business;
and I&rsquo;m going to get to the bottom of it by strategy and
find out what made him take her away from Ned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It don&rsquo;t much matter now. The past is past and it
won&rsquo;t help us to know more than we know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t say that. You can read the future in the
past if you&rsquo;ve got understanding eyes. And I haven&rsquo;t hid
from you I&rsquo;m far from hopeful about the future, because
I can&rsquo;t see them two suiting each other through a lifetime.
They won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you said.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They stood to rest at a bend in the tremendous hill.
Mr. Knox dabbed his brow with a red cotton handkerchief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This blessed mountain brings the beads to the forehead
every time I come up to it,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
a wonder; you hop up like a bird.&rdquo;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Devonshire&mdash;born to hills.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t have valleys without &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. We&rsquo;ve all got to take the rough with the
smooth, and the steep with the level.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To take the rough smoothly is the whole art of living,&rdquo;
declared Philander, &ldquo;and I thought I was pretty
clever at it till I met you. But you can give us all a start
and a beating. Well, this may or may not be a likely moment
to come back to the all important question; but impulse
guides right as often as wrong, and if I&rsquo;m wrong
there&rsquo;s no harm done I hope. Have you had time to turn
it over, or have you been too busy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I owed it to you to turn it over,&rdquo; she answered after
a short pause. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got as much right to go on with
your life as I have to go on with mine. Time don&rsquo;t stand
still because men and women are in two minds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re in two minds&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say that; yet I don&rsquo;t deny it. I have thought
about you. You&rsquo;re a good chap and very restful to the
nerves; and your sense, coming on the foolishness of some
people, shows up in a bright light.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve hardly seen a twinkle of it yet, Lydia. I don&rsquo;t
want to blow my own trumpet, or nothing like that; but
with all my faults, you&rsquo;d find the sense was here, and the
patience.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a marrying sort of man, no doubt, and you&rsquo;ve
got all the makings of a good, restful husband&mdash;I see
that too. But I reckon you haven&rsquo;t looked round far
enough yet. There&rsquo;s a lot against me. I ain&rsquo;t a free
woman by any manner of means, and you don&rsquo;t want to
be saddled with my troubles. That&rsquo;s the worse of marriage
in my opinion. A man says, &lsquo;I take the woman and
not her family,&rsquo; and the woman says the same; but things
don&rsquo;t fall out like that in life. There&rsquo;s always the families,
and nobody can escape from &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;True, but we can be very good friends with our relations
without doing nursemaid&rsquo;s work for &rsquo;em as well as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
our own work. &rsquo;Tis time you stopped working altogether
in my opinion, and had a bit of rest and comfort to your
life&mdash;such a dignified creature as you are by nature.
The farm gets stuffier and stuffier and you can&rsquo;t deny it.
It will tell on your health and break you down. So why
not do as I beg of you and come to me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you ever thought of that nice woman, Alice
Barefoot?&rdquo; asked Lydia suddenly, and Mr. Knox stopped
dead, stared at her through the gloaming and mopped his
head and neck again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good God! What d&rsquo;you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A woman without a care or encumbrance and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not a worthy remark, and
I&rsquo;ll start to forget and forgive it, if you please, this moment.
If you just think all that goes to such a speech
as that, you&rsquo;ll be sorry you made it. A man tells you he
loves you, and you say &lsquo;Try next door.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s bad
enough in itself; but there&rsquo;s more to it and worse even
than that. For it means either you don&rsquo;t know Alice,
or you don&rsquo;t know me. You ought to understand perfectly
well that a woman like her is no more use to me
than a Red Indian. And you do know it; and if you&rsquo;d
thought half a minute, you&rsquo;d never have let yourself say
such a wild and unkind and silly thing as that. It shows
a very great lack of interest in me&mdash;far less interest
than I thought you felt in fact. I&rsquo;m shook, Lydia; I
thought we understood each other better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a fine and a good woman,&rdquo; said Mrs. Trivett
feebly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good she may be, in a bleak sort of way; fine she is
not and you know it. Besides, surely at my time of life a
man wants a mind, if he&rsquo;s got one himself. No doubt you
think the world of Alice Barefoot; but even you ain&rsquo;t
going to argue she&rsquo;s got more mind than would go on a
three-penny piece and leave a margin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&mdash;I was quite wrong,&rdquo; confessed Lydia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were, and since you&rsquo;re sorry, enough said. I&rsquo;ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
resume another time. Here&rsquo;s the top and I won&rsquo;t go no
farther to-night. You ain&rsquo;t yourself, I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do please come and have a glass of cider. Tom thinks
the world of you, Philander.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s better. If you say &lsquo;come,&rsquo; then of course I&rsquo;ll
come. But don&rsquo;t let there be any false pretences about
it. We&rsquo;ve all got to pretend a lot in this world; but I
ain&rsquo;t going to pretend nothing about Tom Dolbear. I
don&rsquo;t visit at Priory Farm for his company, but for yours;
and, if God wills, I&rsquo;ll get you out of it sooner or later,
Lydia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He don&rsquo;t suspect nothing like that,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He does not&mdash;that&rsquo;s certain, else he wouldn&rsquo;t offer
me his cider or anything else. But a time is at hand when
he&rsquo;ll have to face it&mdash;and his wife also. Most women
would have seen through it by now; but she&rsquo;s always asleep,
or half asleep, while you do her work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor Mary,&rdquo; said Mrs. Trivett.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her doom is coming near I hope and trust,&rdquo; he answered.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not doing right at all in standing between
that woman and her duty. You come to me, and
then she&rsquo;ll find that she&rsquo;s only got time to sleep eight
hours in the twenty-four; and she&rsquo;ll also find the meaning
of a family.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They proceeded together and Knox presently smoked
a pipe with Tom; but he seemed not as amiable as usual
and contradicted the farmer&rsquo;s opinion flatly on more than
one occasion.</p>

<p>Mr. Dolbear, however, thought very highly of the vatman
and doubted not that Mr. Knox was right.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I learn from you,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<small>AT &ldquo;THE WATERMAN&rsquo;S ARMS&rdquo;</small></h2></div>


<p>A measure of argument arose between Abel Hayman and
his wife, master and mistress of &ldquo;The Waterman&rsquo;s Arms.&rdquo;
He had held that to receive Medora and Kellock was quite
impossible, while she took a contrary opinion, and her
word was law.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Morals is morals, and business is business,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Hayman, &ldquo;and I know Jordan Kellock by reputation, and
his reputation is all it should be. Dingle will get a bill of
divorcement and they&rsquo;ll be married according to law; and
if they don&rsquo;t come to us, they&rsquo;ll go to the &lsquo;Ring of Bells,&rsquo;
so enough said.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Hayman relented at sound of &ldquo;The Ring of Bells,&rdquo;
and was ready to welcome the guests when they arrived.</p>

<p>It seemed strange to Medora, who had passed the little
inn by the bridge so many times, to enter the door and find
it her home for a season. It was a cool and restful spot,
and the private rooms, facing the stream, were removed
some way from the bar. A yellow rose straggled over
the face of the building and in the garden were old world
flowers, now pushing up to renewed life&mdash;columbines and
bleeding hearts, orange lilies and larkspurs.</p>

<p>Medora arrived weary, and Kellock, to his own surprise,
proved nervous and found himself wishing very heartily
that his first day at work was ended. He knew not what
might be in store for him, and Medora, who was not in a
happy mood, had, in the train, deplored the fact that they
were returning. Nothing would have disappointed her
more than not to do so; yet she meant it at the moment
when she said it, for who does not often contradict his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
own deep-seated desire and side, as it were, against himself
at some passing whim from within, or inspiration
from without?</p>

<p>When she found all her clothes and possessions waiting
for her, Medora fell very silent, and Jordan puzzled to
know how they should have come there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told my mother where we were going to stop,&rdquo; she
explained, &ldquo;but, of course, I never said nothing about my
clothes. I didn&rsquo;t regard them as mine no more&mdash;nor yet
the ornaments.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They meant well. You needn&rsquo;t wear them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Their supper was laid in a little parlour on one side of
the private entrance, and when Medora descended, she
found Mrs. Hayman turning up the lamp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be tired, my dear, I expect,&rdquo; said the elder,
&ldquo;and Mr. Kellock also. Shall I send in bottled beer or
draught?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shan&rsquo;t want nothing in that way. Yes, I will too&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
have a Bass, Mrs. Hayman; but he won&rsquo;t&mdash;he&rsquo;s
teetotal. Was it my mother brought my things?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She did&mdash;her and Daisy Finch. And your mother&rsquo;s
coming over to see you to-morrow morning. I was to be
sure and tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose it have made a bit of stir, Mrs. Hayman?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What have, my dear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me, running away with Mr. Kellock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not that I have heard of. There&rsquo;s such a lot of running
away now-a-days. Though, as a man said in the
bar a few nights ago, there ain&rsquo;t much need for most women
to run. They can go their own pace, so long as it takes
&rsquo;em away from their lawfuls. Take my own niece. She
married a wheelwright, and ran away with a carpenter six
months after. And when she did, far the happiest of
them three people was the wheelwright. Yet the guilty
pair, so to call &rsquo;em, thought he&rsquo;d do dreadful things; they
didn&rsquo;t draw a breath in comfort till they&rsquo;d got to Canada,
and put the ocean between. Marriage, in fact, ain&rsquo;t what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
it was. In my opinion it won&rsquo;t stand the strain much
longer. It was never built to endure against such facilities
for getting about and seeing new faces as the people
have now&mdash;let alone the education. These here life-long
partnerships&mdash;however, no doubt you know all about it.
I&rsquo;m a very broad-minded woman myself, and never throw
a stone, though I don&rsquo;t live in a glass house, for me and
my husband are two of the lucky ones. I&rsquo;ve never wished
for no change, and God help him if he&rsquo;d shown any feeling
of that sort.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Medora little liked the assumption that her achievement
was an affair of every day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Few have got the courage and self-respect to do it,&rdquo;
she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t that. It&rsquo;s selfishness in some cases, and just
common sense in others. We small people are much freer
to act than the upper sort. And as divorce costs a mint
of money, there&rsquo;s thousands and thousands fling up all
hope of an orderly release, and part, and go their own
way, and live respectable lives that make the Church properly
yelp and wring its hands. But the Church is powerless
against the Law, so my husband says; and the Law
takes very good care to keep the whip-hand and make
divorce a great source of income for lawyers. However,
Dingle is a prosperous man, and no doubt he&rsquo;ll run to it
and do the needful. The trouble in these cases is the
children, and lucky that don&rsquo;t arise this time. &rsquo;Tis a very
great thing in my view that a woman should have her
children by the man she prefers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who wants children?&rdquo; asked Medora. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
nothing but a curse and a nuisance most times. Me and
Mr. Kellock want to do important things in the world,
Mrs. Hayman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you can think of anything more important than
getting a brace of good healthy children, I&rsquo;d be glad to
know what it is,&rdquo; answered the landlady. &ldquo;I speak without
prejudice in that matter, never having had none my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>self.
But that&rsquo;s no fault of ours&mdash;merely the will of
Providence, and nothing more puzzling or outrageous ever
happened, for I was one of seven and Abel one of ten; and
yet God willed me barren&mdash;a good mother blasted in the
bud, you might say. I sometimes wish the Almighty would
let Nature take its course a bit oftener.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Medora was glad that Kellock arrived at this moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to have a glass of beer, Jordan,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m properly tired to-night, and I shan&rsquo;t sleep if I
don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He answered nothing, for she had promised to give up
stimulant. Then Mrs. Hayman went to fetch their supper.</p>

<p>Medora enjoyed familiar Devon food, ate well, and slept
well enough presently in a comfortable feather bed, with
the murmur of Bow River for a lullaby.</p>

<p>The next day was Sunday, and Mrs. Trivett duly arrived,
to be received in the little parlour. Medora kissed
her, and Kellock offered to shake hands; but he found that
Lydia was far from cordial. She kissed Medora coldly,
and ignored the man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I felt it my duty to see you, Medora,&rdquo; she began,
&ldquo;because I don&rsquo;t want for you, nor yet Mr. Kellock, to
be under any doubt about my feelings. I think you&rsquo;ve
done a very evil and ill-convenient thing, and I&rsquo;d like to
know what would become of the world if everybody was
to break their oaths and make hay of their marriage lines,
same as you have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Medora quoted from Mrs. Hayman, and Kellock ventured
to think that each case ought to be judged on its
own merits.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I quite understand I&rsquo;m in a very delicate position so
far as you&rsquo;re concerned. I don&rsquo;t expect you to take my
side in the matter, though I&rsquo;m quite confident that in a
year&rsquo;s time, Mrs. Trivett, you&rsquo;ll see this is a blessing in
disguise. And I tell you that Medora&rsquo;s husband that
was, abused his rights, so that it was up to me, who loved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
and respected Medora, to rescue her from him. Because,
if she&rsquo;d stopped under his cruel tyranny much longer,
she&rsquo;d have lost everything that makes life worth living
for man or woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And where did you get this news from? Where did
you hear Ned Dingle was a cruel tyrant, and all the rest
of it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the best possible authority surely. I had it from
Medora herself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a pause, then Lydia proceeded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yesterday, at Ned&rsquo;s wish&mdash;at his wish, mind&mdash;me
and Daisy Finch went to his house and packed up every
stitch belonging to my daughter&mdash;every tiniest thing
that was hers&mdash;and brought &rsquo;em here for her comfort.
You wouldn&rsquo;t call that a cruel thing, would you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You might have saved yourself the trouble, because
Mr. Kellock wouldn&rsquo;t let me wear them even if I wanted
to,&rdquo; said Medora. &ldquo;It shows his nice feeling against my
late husband&rsquo;s coarse feeling&mdash;as if any proper thinking
man could suppose I wanted anything about me to remind
me of the bitter past. I&rsquo;ve got everything new from London.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A pity you couldn&rsquo;t have got a new&mdash;however, I&rsquo;m
not here to lecture you. I&rsquo;m your mother. I&rsquo;ve only a
few things to say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s Mr. Dingle took it?&rdquo; asked Medora.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like a Christian, so far, and will, I hope, to the end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will he see me?&rdquo; enquired Kellock. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t answer
my letter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell as to that. Like the rest of us, he was a
lot surprised that you could come back here after a thing
like this. And Mr. Knox said your point of view was
beyond his experience. He wondered if you expected to
see a triumphal arch put up. But Ned feels more like
an ordinary, decent person, I reckon. He&rsquo;s going. He&rsquo;s
left the Mill, and he&rsquo;s going to put up his house for sale.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he&rsquo;s took it like a Christian, as you say, perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
he&rsquo;ll go farther still,&rdquo; suggested Kellock. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s only
one house in these parts that&rsquo;s like to suit Medora and
myself; but perhaps Dingle&rsquo;s house&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>His dry mind saw nothing impossible about the idea,
but Lydia stared at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What on earth are you made of?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It sounds unreasonable to you? But, if you think of
it, there&rsquo;s nothing unreasonable really. If we&rsquo;re all going
to carry this through in a high-minded way, there&rsquo;s no
more reason why I shouldn&rsquo;t buy, or rent, Dingle&rsquo;s house
than anybody else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Except me,&rdquo; said Medora. &ldquo;And mother&rsquo;s right
there. I wonder at you thinking of such a thing, and
putting me in such a false position&mdash;seeing his ghost
at every corner, and hearing him whistling at every turn.
You haven&rsquo;t got no imagination, Jordan. I wouldn&rsquo;t go
back to that house or cross the threshold, not if it was
built of gold with diamond windows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I stand corrected,&rdquo; answered Kellock mildly. &ldquo;As
for imagination, Medora, you mustn&rsquo;t think I lack for
that. I&rsquo;ve got my vision, else I shouldn&rsquo;t have done what
I have done, or be going to do what I hope to do; but I
grant that while the house is only bricks and mortar to
me, like another, it means more to you&mdash;a prison and a
place of torment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tom-foolery!&rdquo; said Lydia. &ldquo;Nobody ever tormented
Medora but her own silly self, and if you&rsquo;d got
half the sense you think you&rsquo;ve got, Jordan Kellock, you&rsquo;d
have found that out long ago. However, you will find it
out; and I say it before her, for I&rsquo;d never say a word behind
her back that I&rsquo;d fear to say to her face. You&rsquo;ve
took her at her own valuation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no,&rdquo; he replied, flushing. &ldquo;I take her at a
much higher valuation than her own. I want to put her
in a place worthy of her, where she can expand, and be
herself, and reveal what she really is. I want for Medora
to show the world all that&rsquo;s hid in her. She doesn&rsquo;t know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
herself yet; but I know her, and I&rsquo;m going to help her to
let the world see what she is. And I hope as you&rsquo;re not
for us, at any rate, you won&rsquo;t be against us, Mrs. Trivett.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If anybody had told me you&rsquo;d ever do a thing like
this, I wouldn&rsquo;t have believed them,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
not going to pretend to you, or Medora either, that I&rsquo;m
on your side. I think you&rsquo;ve done a very wicked thing,
and what beats me, and will always beat me, is how such a
man as you could have done it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve done a wicked thing, Mrs. Trivett.
I only ask you not to judge. It&rsquo;s no good talking
or explaining all the thousand and one points that decided
me. I only ask you to give me credit on the strength of
my past, and to understand I&rsquo;m no headstrong, silly creature
who dashes at a thing on impulse, regardless of the
consequences to the community at large. Nobody can say
of me I haven&rsquo;t got a proper respect for the community.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s her husband you ought to have respected I should
think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t ask that. When I remember the way he
treated Medora, I can&rsquo;t respect Mr. Dingle. Otherwise
these things wouldn&rsquo;t have happened. I admit I love Medora
and always did do; but I can honestly say that if
Medora had been nothing to me, I should none the less
have tried to save her from such a fate, for common good
feeling to humanity at large. Being as she was and finding,
as she did, that she could love me, of course that simplified
it and made it possible for me to put her in the
strong and unassailable position of my future wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stuff and nonsense,&rdquo; answered Lydia. &ldquo;You think
all this, and I suppose you really believe all this; but
you&rsquo;re blinded by being in love with my daughter. However
the mischief&rsquo;s done now. Only I want you both to
understand that you&rsquo;ll get no sympathy from me&mdash;or
anybody else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want no sympathy,&rdquo; declared Medora.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got each other and we don&rsquo;t expect a little country
place like this to understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jordan dwelt upon a word that Mrs. Trivett had
spoken.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You say &lsquo;the mischief is done,&rsquo; but I can&rsquo;t allow that.
No mischief is done at all&mdash;far from it. The mischief
would have been if Medora and her husband had been
bound to stop together&mdash;chained together against all
their proper feelings and against all decency. But for
them to separate like responsible beings was no mischief.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s up to him to get on with it,&rdquo; added Medora.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve done our share and took the law in our hands,
because we were fearless and knew we were right; and more
we can&rsquo;t do until he acts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has he moved in the matter, Mrs. Trivett?&rdquo; enquired
Kellock. &ldquo;I can supply his lawyer with the necessary
data.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lydia flushed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; he&rsquo;s done nothing to my knowledge. He&rsquo;s got
to think of himself and his future work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be reasonable I&rsquo;m sure. The world being what
it is&mdash;a very critical place&mdash;I&rsquo;m exceedingly jealous
for Medora&rsquo;s good name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In common decency and duty I should think he ought
to feel the same,&rdquo; said Medora. &ldquo;He can&rsquo;t martyr me no
more and the least he can do is to set me free the first
moment possible. He&rsquo;s took ten years off my life and
my looks; and that&rsquo;s about enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, he hasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; returned her mother. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re looking
a lot better than you deserve to look, and as to decency
and duty, there&rsquo;s nobody here will come to you to learn
about either. You&rsquo;re no more a martyr than anybody
else. Ned&rsquo;s the martyr, and it ill becomes you to talk of
him in that hateful tone of voice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kellock was much pained and Medora began to cry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do implore you&mdash;I do implore you, Mrs. Trivett,
to think about this subject on a lofty plane. God&rsquo;s my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
judge I have taken as high a line about this as I knew
how to take. We&rsquo;ve looked at it in a religious spirit and
had every respect for our own characters and every respect
for Mr. Dingle. That&rsquo;s the truth about it. I don&rsquo;t
want to preach or explain how we saw our duty, because
in your present biased frame of mind, you wouldn&rsquo;t believe
me; but I may say that Medora is a sacred object in my
eyes&mdash;just as sacred as anybody else&rsquo;s property is sacred&mdash;and
I&rsquo;d no more treat her with less reverence and honour
than I always did before and after she married, than
I&rsquo;d treat any other woman. I&rsquo;m not going to do anything
on which I could look back with a sigh, or her with
a blush. We&rsquo;re not that sort by any means.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should hope not,&rdquo; murmured Medora. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re a
lot too proud to explain ourselves to such people as live
here; we move on a higher walk of conscience than what
they do, but all I know is that Jordan&rsquo;s a saint and they&rsquo;re
not worthy to black his boots or tie the laces.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Through tears she spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not a saint; but I&rsquo;m a reasonable man and
know what&rsquo;s due to my reputation and my peace of
mind,&rdquo; declared Mr. Kellock, &ldquo;and knowing that, I abide
by it and don&rsquo;t risk losing the only thing that matters,
and don&rsquo;t put myself in such a position that Medora shall
ever think less of me than she does now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think more of you&mdash;more of you every minute of
my life!&rdquo; sobbed Medora.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So there it is, Mrs. Trivett,&rdquo; summed up the man.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you called and I wish it was in my power to
make you see the light in this matter. But we shall appeal
to the future and we&rsquo;re not in the least afraid of the
verdict of posterity. There&rsquo;s no support like the consciousness
of right. In fact for my part I&rsquo;d never take
on anything, big or little, if I didn&rsquo;t feel to the bed-rock
of my conscience it was right. And one thing you can
be quite sure about, and that is that your daughter is as
safe in my hands as it is humanly possible for her to be.&rdquo;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>Mrs. Trivett looked at him helplessly and then at her
weeping child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re one too many for me, Jordan Kellock,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve thrown over every law and gone the limit
so far as I can see; and yet you talk about your honour
and Medora&rsquo;s as the only thing you really care about.
You&rsquo;re beyond me, both of you, and I think I&rsquo;ll wish you
good evening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I feel perfectly sure that light will come into your
mind as the future unfolds itself, Mrs. Trivett.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; she answered; &ldquo;but your idea of light and
mine ain&rsquo;t the same and never will be&mdash;unless you change.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no shadow of changing with me,&rdquo; he answered.
&ldquo;Medora&rsquo;s the first thing in my life henceforth and,
though you don&rsquo;t agree with us, I hope you&rsquo;ll reach a frame
of mind when you&rsquo;ll respect us as we respect ourselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You might stop to tea, mother,&rdquo; suggested Medora,
but Mrs. Trivett declined.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to talk no more,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;so I&rsquo;ll go;
and you needn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m an enemy or anything of that.
I&rsquo;m your mother, Medora, and I&rsquo;m about the most puzzled
mother living this minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lydia went away deeply mystified and disliking Kellock
more than when she had come. Yet she told herself it
was folly to dislike him. He was no hypocrite, and though
his sentiments had seemed ridiculous in any other mouth,
they were really proper to his.</p>

<small>TRAGEDY IN THE SIZING ROOM</small></h2></div>


<p>Jordan Kellock accepted the attitude of the Mill to his
achievement with as little emotion as possible. He concealed
his own feelings, and since he did not attach great
importance to the opinions of his fellow workers, their
jests or silence were alike indifferent to him. He was
conscious of well-doing and felt no doubt that the future
would serve amply to justify his action.</p>

<p>He worked as usual and presently discovered that
neither Ernest Trood, the foreman, nor Matthew Trenchard
himself proposed to discuss his private affairs with
him. The master never mentioned it, and when he met
Kellock, shook hands with his usual large friendliness and
trusted the vatman had enjoyed his holiday.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You went to the Exhibition I hope?&rdquo; he asked. And
Jordan replied that he had done so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our pictures made a proper sensation,&rdquo; he declared.
&ldquo;I stood by and watched the public for an hour, and the
people were more astonished at our water-mark pictures
than anything in the show.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall see what the press said,&rdquo; replied Trenchard.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had very good notices about it and far beyond
the trade too. Art papers have taken up water-marks
and pointed out what I told you long ago, that the craft
ought to have a great future.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of Medora nothing was said, but Trood mentioned her
briefly a few days later. He took Kellock aside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s official, and no more,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;But I suppose
you stand for Mrs. Dingle now, and are going to
marry her as soon as it can be done?&rdquo;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>&ldquo;That is so, Trood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, she went away without warning, and forfeits her
money accordingly. You know the law on that subject.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Kellock. &ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t mean
nothing uncivil or improper, but the circumstances required
her to act as she did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trood nodded and left him. In common with most of
the other responsible men in the Mill, he never addressed
Kellock on the subject of Medora. Jordan noticed this,
and felt that though people abstained from comment, his
action had created a body of opinion that was to some
extent unfriendly. None hesitated to regret the departure
of Ned Dingle, and none attempted to conceal that regret
in the presence of Kellock. A few men refused to recognise
him farther, and when he saluted them as usual, cut
him. Robert Life was one of these, and he found that
those who came immediately under the influence of Nicholas
Pinhey&mdash;the men at the glazing rollers&mdash;had been
imbued with particular animosity. There Medora herself
had worked.</p>

<p>As for her, she lived through a familiar experience, and
discovered that anticipation is greater than reality, both
for good and evil. She had built up a very elaborate picture
of her return to Dene, and of the attitude of her
circle. It was a vision wherein she occupied the centre,
as a being mysterious and arresting, a figure to challenge
hatred, or enthusiasm, a compelling heroine, who might
provoke furious enemies, or win loyal friends, but could
by no possibility leave anyone indifferent. She had pictured
herself as the protagonist, the cynosure, the paramount
object of interest. When she walked abroad in
her London clothes, all eyes would be upon her, and she
would move among them, gentle, indifferent, inscrutable,
her secrets hidden, herself doubtless a subject of ceaseless
and heated discussion.</p>

<p>But she missed the least consciousness of creating a
sensation; she even missed the unpleasantness which she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
had designed to endure so finely, that Jordan might see
the superb stuff of which she was really made. The limelight
of public attention was wanting, and her return fell
almost as flat as when she had come home from her honeymoon
with Ned Dingle. So far as Medora could see, nobody
really cared a button about her. She met with the
same experiences as Jordan, but took them differently.
He returned to his occupation and, in the full tide of work,
was able to keep his mind free of his private affairs, and
find other interests among his fellow craftsmen. But
Medora had no distraction during this period. She possessed
not even a house to look after, until Kellock found
a house. Following on the first clash with her fellow creatures,
and the discovery that some were amiable as usual,
and some unprepared to recognise her, or have anything
more to do with her, Medora began to be unspeakably
bored with life and this flat anticlimax. The spring days
dragged, and she knew not how to fill them. But her
partner, perceiving this, set her a variety of tasks, and
she found herself making notes for him from books, and
copying extracts out of speeches delivered by the leaders
of labour&rsquo;s cause. At first she performed her tasks with
energy, and Kellock praised her devotion; but he blamed
her handwriting, which was very indifferent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some day I&rsquo;ll run to a typewriter,&rdquo; he had promised.</p>

<p>The matter upon which he occupied her quite failed to
interest Medora. It was dreary in itself and depressing
in all that it implied, because their future, so far as she
could see, held mighty little promise of much comfort or
prosperity, if Jordan proposed to devote his life to these
thorny and controversial subjects. It was magnificent,
and might mean fame for him after he was dead; but
promised remarkably little fun for Mrs. Kellock in the
meantime.</p>

<p>Daisy Finch proved faithful and often came to see
Medora at &ldquo;The Waterman&rsquo;s Arms.&rdquo; She believed that
the opposition need not be taken seriously.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a nine days&rsquo; wonder,&rdquo; declared Daisy.
&ldquo;When you&rsquo;re married to Mr. Kellock, everybody will
come round.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Miss Finch plunged into her own affairs. She
was betrothed to Kellock&rsquo;s coucher at the Mill, one Harold
Spry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And your mother thinks he&rsquo;s a very sensible man, and
we&rsquo;re going into Paignton on Saturday, by the motor bus
for him to buy me a proper engagement ring.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a very good coucher, for I&rsquo;ve heard Jordan say
so; and I know he&rsquo;s very nice looking, and I&rsquo;m very glad
about it, Daisy. It&rsquo;s good news, for certain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never encouraged him, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; declared Miss
Finch, &ldquo;but I always felt greatly addicted to him in a
manner of speaking, Medora.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll be happy, but don&rsquo;t hurry it; get to
know each other&rsquo;s natures well, and all that. And if you
find you can&rsquo;t agree about anything that&rsquo;s vital to happiness,
then part before it&rsquo;s too late,&rdquo; said her friend. &ldquo;It
isn&rsquo;t given to every girl to do what I did, Daisy. You
want a rare lot of courage, and the power to rise superior
to the world against you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He agrees with me in everything,&rdquo; said Daisy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They always begin like that. But I feel you&rsquo;re going
to be one of the happy ones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you, too, I hope soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are greater things than happiness, I find,&rdquo; confessed
Medora, &ldquo;though like all young creatures, I used
to put happiness first and last. But if you&rsquo;ve got much
in the way of brains, you can&rsquo;t be happy for long. Jordan
very soon learned me that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely to God he&rsquo;s going to make you happy?&rdquo; asked
Daisy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, but it&rsquo;s the happiness of people at large he&rsquo;s
out for. He&rsquo;s got a great mind and thinks in numbers,
not in individuals, even though one of them&rsquo;s his wife.
That may sound sad to you.&rdquo;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>&ldquo;It do,&rdquo; said Daisy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it isn&rsquo;t really. It makes you forget yourself&mdash;in
time. I shall rise to it as I age, and I&rsquo;m ageing fast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to forget myself,&rdquo; said Daisy, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m
sure Mr. Spry wouldn&rsquo;t let me if I did. He&rsquo;s death on
spoiling me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be happy while you can,&rdquo; advised Medora. &ldquo;And
bring your young man to supper one night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They talked of the works, for despite the larger interests
of Kellock, Medora still found the politics of the
Mill her chief subject.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think they&rsquo;d be nasty if I was to go in one
day on some pretence and see &rsquo;em?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>Daisy considered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d be welcome for your mother&rsquo;s sake in the rag
house,&rdquo; she answered; &ldquo;but I wouldn&rsquo;t go in your own
shop, if I was you. I dare say it&rsquo;s jealousy, but the
women in the glazing shop&mdash;it&rsquo;s old Pinhey&rsquo;s fault
largely, I believe. He&rsquo;s a religious old devil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For some things I&rsquo;d almost like to be back again,&rdquo;
declared Medora. &ldquo;Just for the minute, till we&rsquo;ve got
a house and so on, I&rsquo;m at a loose end. I do a lot of writing
for Jordan, and he finds me very useful, and is going
to get me a typewriter. But just for the minute&mdash;it
would distract my mind. There&rsquo;s nothing small about
Mr. Trenchard&mdash;he&rsquo;d let me come back, I reckon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Daisy did not venture an opinion, and the talk returned
to Harold Spry. But from that day, Medora&rsquo;s determination
to go into the works increased. She did not tell
Jordan, suspecting that he would have forbidden such an
experiment, nor did she mention the matter to her mother;
but she decided that she would stroll in some day.</p>

<p>Ned Dingle had not yet left Dene, and once she passed
him returning home from Totnes. He took no notice of
her, and she hesitated whether to speak, but perceived
that he desired no such thing, for he hurried past. She
stole one glance under her eyelids at him, and thought he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
looked much as usual. He stared straight in front of
him, and blushed as he passed her.</p>

<p>She mentioned the incident to Kellock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen him yet,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t got
work to his liking, so Knox tells me. I&rsquo;m waiting to hear
from him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Two days later, Medora took her courage in her hands,
and went up to the Mill at eleven o&rsquo;clock, while work was
in full swing. She had considered where to go, and decided
that she would drop into the vat room and speak
to Jordan about some trivial matter. She took an addition
to his dinner in the shape of an orange. But having
actually arrived, an inspiration led her to the sizing room.
Thither came the paper from the drying lofts, and the
simple work was done by little girls. No sharp word
or unpleasant attitude of mind was likely to reach her
there.</p>

<p>She entered unseen, and passed through the dim and
odorous chambers where the sizerman, old Amos Toft,
mixed the medium. Here, in two steaming vats, Amos
melted his gelatine, made of buffalo hide, and added to
the strong-smelling concoction those ingredients proper
to the paper to be sized. Trade secrets controlled the
mixture, but alum contributed an important factor, for
without it, the animal compound had quickly decayed.</p>

<p>In the sizing room a narrow passage ran between long
troughs. The place steamed to its lofty, sunny roof, and
was soaked with the odour of the size. Through the
great baths of amber-coloured liquid there wound an endless
wool blanket, and at one end of each great bath sat
two little girls with stacks of dry paper beside them.
They disposed the sheets regularly two together on the
sizing felt, and the paper was drawn into the vats and
plunged beneath the surface. For nearly three minutes
it pursued its invisible way, and presently, emerging at
the other end, was lifted off by other young workers and
returned to the drying lofts again.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>Little Mercy Life, the vatman&rsquo;s daughter, was sizing
some pretty, rose-coloured sheets, and Medora admired
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Mercy, how are you?&rdquo; she asked, and the child
smiled and said she was very well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What lovely paper! And how are you, Nelly?
How&rsquo;s your sister?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To home still,&rdquo; said Mercy&rsquo;s companion, &ldquo;but the
doctor says she&rsquo;ll get well some day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An impulse brought the orange out of Medora&rsquo;s pocket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s something for you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You can share
it between you presently.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They thanked her, and chatted happily enough about
their work and play. Medora told them that she had been
in London, and interested them with what she saw at the
Zoological Gardens.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My! To think!&rdquo; said Mercy. &ldquo;I thought squirrels
was always red.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A few adults passed through the sizing house, among
them Mr. Trood. He hesitated, seemed surprised to see
her, but said &ldquo;good morning,&rdquo; not unpleasantly, and
hoped she was all right.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dare say you half wish you were back again, Medora?&rdquo;
he asked, and she jumped at the suggestion and
told him that she often did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just peeped in for the pleasure of seeing friends,&rdquo; she
said.</p>

<p>He went his way and Medora was about to leave the
children and seek Kellock, when an adventure very painful
befell her.</p>

<p>For old Amos Toft belonged to the tribe of Mr. Pinhey.
He was inflamed with indignation at the spectacle
of Medora contaminating youth, and departed presently
that he might tell Mrs. Life, in the glazing shop, what was
happening. Whereupon, Mercy Life, the elder, leapt from
her stool at the crib, and much incensed, hastened to her
child&rsquo;s protection.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>Medora greeted her with a smile, but it vanished before
the other&rsquo;s sharp challenge.</p>

<p>They were talking of primroses at the time, for Nelly
and Mercy had plucked a great bunch on Sunday and
promised to bring some to Medora. They were to come
to tea with her when they could.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&mdash;I&rsquo;ll thank you to get out of this, Mrs.&mdash;whatever
you call yourself!&rdquo; began the angry woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo; asked Medora, &ldquo;and
who are you to tell me what I&rsquo;m to do? Where&rsquo;s your
manners?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other snorted scornfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You brazen-faced thing,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Yes, a front
of brass to come here, or show your face among honest
women I should think. But you can&rsquo;t have it both ways.
You can&rsquo;t be a friend for children and give &rsquo;em oranges&mdash;give
it back, Mercy&mdash;and be a scarlet woman both.
And I won&rsquo;t have you talking to my child anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Medora adopted a superior tone. She took the orange
from the girl and addressed her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry you&rsquo;ve got such a fool for a mother, Mercy.
And I hope when you grow up, you&rsquo;ll have more sense than
she has.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then she addressed Mrs. Life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How little you understand,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for
you being such a narrow-minded creature. I always
thought you was one of the sensible sort. And you
needn&rsquo;t fear for your little girl. I was only asking her
to come to tea and bring me some primroses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She marched out, regardless of Mrs. Life&rsquo;s reply, and
went to seek Jordan who was at his vat making big paper.
He handled a heavy mould and passed over snow-white
sheets to his coucher, who turned them on to the felt with
extreme care. Jordan became very nervous at sight of
Medora, but she felt quite at ease among the men and
none in the vat room quarrelled with her. She congratulated
Harold Spry on his engagement and told him that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
Daisy was a treasure. Then she gave Kellock the orange
and watched him.</p>

<p>But Medora was only hiding herself. Her heart flamed
and her indignation at the recent affront burned fiercely
within her. Her sole purpose at that moment was to get
level and more than level with Mrs. Life, whose husband
worked at the vat next to Jordan&rsquo;s, and she now turned
on him unwisely and addressed him. He was employed
with brilliant, orange-coloured pulp and making currency
paper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You tell your wife to be broader-minded, Robert Life,&rdquo;
she said suddenly, and he stared at her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s broad-minded enough for me and all God-fearing
creatures I believe,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;If you want to keep
on the narrow path, you&rsquo;ve got to be narrow-minded about
some things, young woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was too much for Kellock. His pale face flushed.
He set down his mould, dried his hands and beckoned to
Medora.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to speak to you for five minutes,&rdquo; he said and
they moved together into the open space outside the vat
house. But she gave him no time to speak. She poured
out her wrongs in a flood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s up to you now,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t going on.
I&rsquo;m not going to have my life made a burden by every
beastly, cross-grained cat in Dene for you, or anybody.
An ignorant creature like her to call me a bad woman!
That&rsquo;s the limit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must be patient,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t have
come, Medora. It was a very doubtful thing to do. You
must allow for people. We&rsquo;ve talked all this out before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we&rsquo;ve done right, we&rsquo;ve done right,&rdquo; she answered;
&ldquo;and if we&rsquo;ve done right, it isn&rsquo;t for me to sit down under
insult, or for you to let me be insulted. I was born a
fighter and you say you was; and if so, you&rsquo;d best to begin
with fighting your future wife&rsquo;s enemies.&rdquo;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;But I ask you to be
reasonable. It wasn&rsquo;t reasonable to come here and face
the women.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t face the women then. I didn&rsquo;t go near &rsquo;em.
I was only asking a child or two to come into tea. Then
that sour slattern, Mercy Life, flew at me as if I&rsquo;d come
to poison her little girl. And I want to know what you&rsquo;re
going to do about it; and I&rsquo;ve a right to know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep calm, keep calm and go home, Medora. Go back
to the &lsquo;Arms.&rsquo; We&rsquo;ll talk about it to-night. It&rsquo;s hard
waiting, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t wait. I&rsquo;ve no right to be asked to wait.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, as to that, we&rsquo;ve got to wait. You say it&rsquo;s up
to me. But you know different.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll drown myself if there&rsquo;s much more of it&mdash;God&rsquo;s
my judge,&rdquo; vowed Medora, then she went her way as the
bell rang the dinner hour.</p>

<p>Kellock felt deeply perturbed, and was glad of the interval,
for he could not have resumed his work just then.
He ate his meal alone and then wandered up the valley with
painful thoughts for companions. That Medora could
have done so foolish and inconsiderate a thing surprised
him harshly. It was part of his illusion concerning her
that she was a girl of unusual reasoning powers and excellent
mental endowments. Once or twice, indeed, she had
said and done what cast a shadow on this conviction; but
never had she indicated the possibility of such a futile act
as this. That she should have come to the Mill at her own
inclination appeared flagrantly foolish.</p>

<p>But that evening, in face of her tears and hysterical
emotion, he undertook to anticipate the position and hasten
the solution if possible. Not, indeed, until he promised
to seek out Ned Dingle and demand action from him, did
Medora recover. Then she was herself again, humble and
grateful and penitent and full of admiration for Jordan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so large-minded and look at things with a male
grasp and a male&rsquo;s power of waiting,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
you can&rsquo;t expect that from me. You must make allowances,
Jordan. I suffer a lot more than you do, because
I&rsquo;ve got such a power of feeling and I&rsquo;m cruel proud.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m properly jealous for you,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;and
I&rsquo;d come between every breath of scandal and you if I
could. But we must allow for human nature and prejudice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And jealousy,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must allow for the outlook of every-day people
and give &rsquo;em as little chance to scoff as possible. I&rsquo;ll put
it to Mr. Dingle the first minute I can; and you must do
your part, Medora, and lie low till I&rsquo;ve seen him and
shown him his duty.&rdquo;</p>

<small>NED HEARS MR. KNOX</small></h2></div>


<p>Kellock thought twice about going to see Ned Dingle, for
instinct told him that what might seem a reasonable course
to such a reasonable being as himself, would possibly appear
in another light to Medora&rsquo;s husband. But he reflected
that, as the more intelligent and better educated
man, it was his place to act. Even should Dingle use violence,
that much he must be prepared to face, if by so
doing he could advance the situation between them.</p>

<p>Ned was still at his house, and, on an evening in early
April, when the trees of Ashprington were washed with
green again and the white blossoms of the pears opened
ghostly to the embrace of the east wind, Jordan called.</p>

<p>Ned himself opened the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What the hell do you want? I&rsquo;ve
kept off you&mdash;God knows how. Are you asking for it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to do what&rsquo;s right, Mr. Dingle. I haven&rsquo;t
come for any less reason. I beg you&rsquo;ll let me speak to
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ned breathed through his nostrils and did not reply
immediately. At last he answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To do what&rsquo;s right! You&rsquo;ll never do what&rsquo;s right,
because you&rsquo;re a hypocrite, and all your talk about helping
labour and the rest of it is humbug and lies coming
from a thing like you. You&rsquo;re the worst sort of man&mdash;the
sort that does his dirty work behind a lot of cant and
pretended virtue and honesty. The gutter&rsquo;s too good for
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can see your point of view; but after her letter, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
ought to think different. I say nothing about mine; but
hers was all it ought to be under the circumstances.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You dare to say that? All it ought to be? Did you
read it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And thought it right for her to say I was &lsquo;a godless
beast&rsquo; where she was concerned?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She never said nothing like that, Mr. Dingle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come in then,&rdquo; said the other shortly. &ldquo;You come
in and sit down and read what she said.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They went into the kitchen, and Ned lighted a candle.
Then he took out his pocket book, produced Medora&rsquo;s letter,
and flung it on the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Read that, please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kellock obeyed, and his face grew long. It was clear
that Medora had not sent the letter they concocted
so carefully together in the Priory ruin. He put it
down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was that the only letter you got from her, if I may
ask?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never heard nothing about this letter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re lying I expect when you say that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, I am not. I never lie. This letter was evidently
the result of temper. She never meant it. It&rsquo;s
a sort of play-acting&mdash;all females indulge in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She meant every word. But you&rsquo;re right, there&rsquo;s a
lot of play-acting about the whole business. She&rsquo;s been
play-acting ever since she was born, and now she&rsquo;ll damned
soon find that&rsquo;s ended. Life with you won&rsquo;t be play-acting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will not,&rdquo; answered Kellock. &ldquo;I promise her that.
But she&rsquo;s no dreamer. If you&rsquo;ll be so patient as to listen
to me, I&rsquo;d like to speak a few words for her and myself.
That letter is not Medora&mdash;not what she is now. She
shall say she&rsquo;s sorry, and write in her present frame of
mind, which is very different.&rdquo;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be sorry all right. That won&rsquo;t be a lie anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I venture to ask you to look ahead, Mr. Dingle.
There&rsquo;s no doubt, owing to one thing and another, you
and her wouldn&rsquo;t have settled down into a happy husband
and wife. That&rsquo;s not to cast any reflection on you, or
her either. You wasn&rsquo;t made for each other as we all
thought, myself included, when she took you. But owing
to differences of character and such like, she fretted you
by her nature, which she couldn&rsquo;t alter, and you treated
her harsh according to your nature, which you couldn&rsquo;t
change. There it was, and her spirit told her you and
her must part. She meant to go I solemnly assure you.
She&rsquo;d made up her mind to do that; and finding it was
so&mdash;that&rsquo;s where I came in. I thought she was right,
for her self-respect and yours, to leave you, and knowing
that she would then be free in every real sense, I, who had
loved her in the past, felt it was no wrong to you under
the circumstances, to love her again. But I&rsquo;ll say this,
and I hope you&rsquo;ll believe it: if I had thought Medora was
wrong, I wouldn&rsquo;t have taken her part. You&rsquo;ll remember
I spoke to you as an outsider, and only for your good,
when you knocked me in the water. I&rsquo;d no thought of
having Medora for my wife till after that happened. But
when she made me see clearly she was a martyred creature,
then I took a different line. And that&rsquo;s how we stand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Play-acting still,&rdquo; answered the other. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all
play-acting, and a wicked, heartless piece of work; and
you know it. And a brainless piece of work too, for all
you think you&rsquo;re such a smart pair. You see I&rsquo;m calm.
I&rsquo;m not taking you by the scruff of your neck and battering
your head against that wall, as I well might do. I
may yet; but I&rsquo;ll answer you first. You knew Medora,
and knew she was a mass of airs and graces, and humbug;
and you knew me, and therefore you ought to have known,
when she said I was a tyrant and a brute, that she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
lying. But you fooled yourself and took her word and
made yourself believe her, because you wanted her. You
lusted after another man&rsquo;s wife, and all your fine opinions
went to hell under the temptation, when you found you
could get her so easy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that; I beg you not to put it in that way.
I&rsquo;m not that sort of man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I judge of a man by what he does, not by what he
says. That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ve done, and that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ll
pay for sooner or late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A time will come when you&rsquo;ll withdraw that, Mr.
Dingle. It&rsquo;s a cruel libel on my character and you&rsquo;ll live
to know it. At present I&rsquo;m only wishful to do things
decently and in order, and I&rsquo;ll ask you again to look forward.
I should be very glad to know, please, when you&rsquo;re
going to go on with this? I venture to think you ought to
move in the matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You beat anything I&rsquo;ve ever heard of,&rdquo; said Dingle.
&ldquo;What are you made of&mdash;flesh and blood, or stone? To
tell me my duty!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not, if you don&rsquo;t see it? I&rsquo;m not thinking of
myself&mdash;only the situation as it affects her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m thinking of it as it affects me. I&rsquo;ve been
pretty badly damaged in this racket&mdash;the lawyer&rsquo;s made
that clear to me. I shall get it out of you somehow&mdash;how
I don&rsquo;t know at present. You can clear now, and I
shan&rsquo;t come to you to decide what I&rsquo;m going to do about
it&mdash;or to that wicked, little fool either. Yes, a wicked,
little fool&mdash;that&rsquo;s what she is&mdash;and she&rsquo;ll look at home
presently, when you&rsquo;ve knocked the life out of her, and
find it out for herself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kellock rose and prepared to depart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I called if it was only to anger you,&rdquo; he
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; and you&rsquo;ll be sorry for lots of things presently
I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder. You&rsquo;re a fool too, come to think of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
it&mdash;that&rsquo;s part of my revenge I reckon&mdash;to know you,
who thought yourself so wonderful, are only a young fool
after all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the interview ended and Kellock went his way outwardly
unruffled but inwardly perturbed. He had never
considered the possibility of Dingle doing anything in the
way of damages. He had, in fact, thought far too little
about Dingle. Ned was a man of no force of character
and he had assumed that he would proceed upon the conventional
lines proper to such cases. But Ned&rsquo;s very
weakness now grew into a danger, because he was evidently
in the hands of a lawyer and might be easily influenced by
a stronger will than his own. The law would probably
not learn the real human facts of the situation as between
Ned and Medora. The law never did go into these subtleties
of character upon which such things depended. Superficially
the law might hold him, what he&mdash;Kellock&mdash;was
so far from being, and perhaps actually punish him in
his pocket&mdash;an event that had not entered his calculations.
Did Dingle make any such claim, it would certainly
be his place to plead against it, or get a lawyer
to do so for him. He felt anxious, for he feared the law
and knew it to be a terribly costly matter to defend the
most righteous cause.</p>

<p>And meantime Ned received another caller, who knew
Kellock better than he did, and left him with some curious
information to consider. Indeed it was not Jordan&rsquo;s own
visit that threw any new light on Jordan, but that of an
older man. Philander Knox now arrived to see Dingle
on private business.</p>

<p>Philander, true to his philosophic and tolerant attitude,
had not evinced any unfriendly feelings towards
Kellock on his return to the vat house, and the paper
makers, who were all junior to Mr. Knox, followed his
lead with the exception of Robert Life, who took his wife&rsquo;s
view of the situation. Thus it came about that finding
Knox to be impartial and knowing him for a large-minded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
man, only puzzling when he displayed humour, which Kellock
did not understand, Jordan had to some extent confided
in him and revealed various facts concerning his
opinions and his relations with Medora. These, while imparted
in confidence, possessed none the less very considerable
significance and Philander was now tempted to use
his information.</p>

<p>It depended on the trend of his conversation with Dingle
whether he would do so, for he called upon his own affairs
and had no intention, when he arrived, to touch those of
other people.</p>

<p>He came by appointment on the subject of Dingle&rsquo;s
house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like it very well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;d close to-night
if I was in a position to do so; but though hopeful as my
custom is, for hope costs nothing, I&rsquo;m not able yet to
close definitely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one or two after it, I must tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know. But I&rsquo;ll make a bargain. To let the house
is, of course, a certainty. Houses are so few in these
parts that a fine quality of house like this don&rsquo;t go begging
very long; but if you&rsquo;ll stand by and give me first
refusal for a clear month, I&rsquo;ll pay you two quid down on
the nail for the privilege.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dingle considered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a bargain. There&rsquo;s
nothing settled and I&rsquo;d be very well pleased for you to
have the house. But what are you waiting for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s private,&rdquo; answered Philander bringing out his
purse and depositing two sovereigns. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m waiting for
another party to come to a decision on a certain subject.
If it goes right, I&rsquo;ll take your house; if it don&rsquo;t, then I
shan&rsquo;t have no use for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dingle nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess your meaning,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;As for me, I&rsquo;m
marking time, though I can&rsquo;t much longer. I must go on
with my work and I&rsquo;ve got a very good offer for Liverpool;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
but I don&rsquo;t see myself in a town somehow. And there&rsquo;s
people at Ivybridge could do with me; but the money&rsquo;s
less. I&rsquo;m all over the shop, to be honest. Of course it
won&rsquo;t go no farther. But I can trust you. I keep a stiff
upper-lip, being a man; but this have knocked the stuffing
out of me. I don&rsquo;t care what becomes of me really, though
of course I pretend I&rsquo;m all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Knox nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve took a very proper line in the opinion of me
and Mrs. Trivett,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Mrs. Trivett shares your
feelings about it. As for me, I&rsquo;m properly sorry, because
one can&rsquo;t do nothing to help. She&rsquo;s done for herself now,
and she&rsquo;ll smart long after you&rsquo;ve done smarting, if that&rsquo;s
any consolation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know; but I don&rsquo;t want her to smart particular,&rdquo;
said Ned. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s been sinned against&mdash;took at her own
ridiculous valuation. She had to be herself, poor wretch;
but the more I think of it&mdash;I ain&rsquo;t sure now if it wouldn&rsquo;t
be best to break that man&rsquo;s neck, Knox. Yes, I reckon
I&rsquo;ll go to Liverpool. I don&rsquo;t want to bide here within a
few miles of her. A clean break&rsquo;s the best. How&rsquo;s the
new beaterman going on?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;None too well. Trenchard don&rsquo;t like him and Trood
hates him. He told Trood to mind his own business last
week; and coming from Bulstrode&mdash;Bulstrode&rsquo;s his name&mdash;to
the foreman, that was a startler. In fact Trood
won&rsquo;t be himself till Bulstrode&rsquo;s gone now. He&rsquo;s a doomed
man you may say. Then there was a little affair with
Trenchard too. He wants some more of the advertisements
made&mdash;the pictures&mdash;and he explained the pulp
to Bulstrode, and Bulstrode, good though he is at everyday
work, have a rigid mind and said he was there to make
paper pulp, not do conjuring tricks. An unyielding sort
of man in fact; and though of course he&rsquo;s doing what
he&rsquo;s told as well as he can, he don&rsquo;t like it, and no doubt
he&rsquo;ll soon be gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was here a bit ago&mdash;Kellock, I mean,&rdquo; said Ned.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
&ldquo;I often wonder how I keep my hands off the man that&rsquo;s
ruined my home; but so far I have. There&rsquo;s something
uncanny to him. He ain&rsquo;t human, Knox. He&rsquo;s got a
something else in him that puts him outside the run of
humans. A bit of fish or frog. I ain&rsquo;t frightened of
smiting him; I may come to it; but I can&rsquo;t explain. He&rsquo;s
not like other people. I always feel he&rsquo;s an image&mdash;a
machine made to look and talk like a man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand that. If another chap had done this, I
should have expected you to go for him; but I quite see the
case is altered with Kellock. Because you feel he&rsquo;s not
stuffed with the same stuffing as most of us. Stop me if
I&rsquo;m on dangerous ground; but such a man has the qualities
of his failings. He&rsquo;s got a properly absurd side&mdash;like all
such owl-like people, who never laugh. He&rsquo;s a crank and
amazingly ignorant in some directions. If he don&rsquo;t approve
of the law, he won&rsquo;t obey it. He puts religion and
morals higher than law; but he brews his own religion and
don&rsquo;t know in his innocence that religion in this country
always does what the State tells it. You&rsquo;d think religion
might up and speak to the law, in the name of its Master
sometimes. Kellock pointed that out. He would do
things and talk to the law if he had the power, because he&rsquo;s
fearless and doesn&rsquo;t waste his energy, but concentrates.
He said, speaking of natural children, that under our laws
they were treated with wicked injustice. He said to me
about it, &lsquo;If the Archbishop of Canterbury got up in the
House of Lords and said that it was a black, damnable disgrace
to England to have such a law blotting the Statute
Book and leaving us behind Scotland and Germany and
America&mdash;if he did that, all men and women of good will
would support him and the State would have to end the
loathsome scandal.&rsquo; But I told him to hope nothing either
from bishops or lawyers. &lsquo;The man who alters that infamous
law will be somebody bigger than either one or
t&rsquo;other,&rsquo; I told Kellock. &lsquo;He&rsquo;ll be a brave man, ashamed
to face both ways and sit on the fence for his own safety;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
and he&rsquo;ll be a man who knows that mankind wasn&rsquo;t made
for the lawyers, but the lawyers for mankind.&rsquo; There are
such men still, thank God.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kellock ain&rsquo;t human, so how should he care for the
ways of the world? It&rsquo;s a blind to his villainy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a good deal of speech with him of late and
heard his opinions. He&rsquo;s dead sure he&rsquo;s right. It&rsquo;s all in
a nutshell. He had to rescue your wife from you, and now
he&rsquo;s as jealous for her as a hen with one chick. It&rsquo;s
damned hard to look at the situation from his point of
view, Dingle&mdash;hard for me or anybody&mdash;and impossible
for you; but he sees it in a certain way and no doubt she&rsquo;s
helped him to do so. And now he won&rsquo;t have a breath on
her name and feels he&rsquo;s got to stand between her and the
rest of the world. He smarts worse than she does when
hard things are said. He&rsquo;s a lot more high strung than
your wife herself. In fact he&rsquo;s so delicate about her that
he&rsquo;d rather die than leave her in a false position. It&rsquo;s an
attitude that would be cant in most chaps, but coming from
him you&rsquo;re bound to believe it. It may be part fish or
frog, as you say; but so it is. Of course nobody who
didn&rsquo;t know him would believe it; but I do believe it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Believe what?&rdquo; asked Dingle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Believe she&rsquo;s not married to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s certain while she&rsquo;s married to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean that. I mean Kellock&rsquo;s not all a man, as
I&rsquo;ve just said. You may say he&rsquo;s a bit of a saint, or you
may say he&rsquo;s only half baked; but say what you like, the
fact remains he&rsquo;s different from other men and his opinions
guide his conduct, which is a lot more than opinions always
do. He&rsquo;s told me that she&rsquo;s not his wife in any sort of
way&mdash;far too much respect for her and himself. That&rsquo;s
gospel you may be sure, for he&rsquo;d rather die than lie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll soon get fed up with that,&rdquo; said Dingle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sooner than him I dare say; but so it is, and I&rsquo;m glad
to let you know it. I shook him by telling him he was a
child in these things and that the law would refuse to let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
you divorce Mrs. Dingle, if it knew he was not fulfilling its
requirements. But he&rsquo;s got a feeling of contempt for the
divorce laws which, of course, every decent man must share&mdash;a
feeling of contempt which extends to the lawyers who
live by them, and the parsons who like &rsquo;em. I give him all
credit there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how do these fine ideas strike my wife that was?&rdquo;
asked Ned. &ldquo;Because if I knew anything about her in her
palmy days, she was built of quite different mud from
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How it strikes her I can&rsquo;t tell you, because her opinions
are hid from me. Perhaps Mrs. Trivett&rsquo;s heard her
views upon the subject. She may not agree with Kellock;
but more likely he&rsquo;s made her do so&mdash;especially seeing it
won&rsquo;t pay her to have any other opinions than his in
future.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll never break her in, Knox.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He will, give him time. There&rsquo;s something about him
that makes weaker wills go down sooner or late. He&rsquo;s like
the tide. He will come on. He&rsquo;ll settle her all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She deserves what she&rsquo;ll get anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If she do, she&rsquo;s one in a thousand,&rdquo; answered Knox,
&ldquo;for in my experience we always get more or less than we
deserve, never a fair, honest deal. You can&rsquo;t tell what
she&rsquo;s going to get, but you can bet your boots it won&rsquo;t be
what she deserves. Be it as it will, you&rsquo;re in the position of
Providence to both of them; because whatever she may
think about it, we know what he does. He&rsquo;s in your hand&mdash;to
make, or mar, so far as Medora&rsquo;s concerned. I tell
you for friendship, and to a man like myself, who loves a
joke, these things are funny in a manner of speaking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The question is if they&rsquo;re true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re true as sure as Kellock is true. Make no
mistake about that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not the sort to stab in the dark, though
that&rsquo;s how they served me. But I don&rsquo;t feel no particular
call to put myself out of the way for either of &rsquo;em. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
can&rsquo;t get this job through for nothing, and I&rsquo;ve got no
spare cash for the minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They chose their own time to run; they must await
yours for the rest,&rdquo; admitted Mr. Knox.</p>

<small>EMOTIONS OF MEDORA</small></h2></div>


<p>When Jordan returned to Medora, by a quality of our
common nature which he would have been the first to deprecate,
he was not entirely sorry to bring her unpleasant
news. To himself he said that a trial of her patience
would be good for her character, and so explained his own
frame of mind; but the truth was different. He had heard
something concerning Medora which annoyed him and
made him anxious; and the result of his annoyance was that
he imparted painful facts without any very great regret.
It was true that they affected him as well as his future wife,
but his nature was qualified to bear them far better than
was hers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am a great deal hurt,&rdquo; he began, as they sat together
in their little parlour at the inn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were bound to be,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;And you
might have been hurt in body as well as in mind. It&rsquo;s
something if he&rsquo;s enough broken in to treat you properly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As to that, he did. I&rsquo;ll come to him. But what&rsquo;s hurt
me, Medora, a long way worse than anything Mr. Dingle
had to say has got to do with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve been believing his lies&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t so much his lies as yours. I&rsquo;m not one to use
hard words as a rule. But it&rsquo;s your letter to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what about it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve read it&mdash;that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She realised the significance of this and blushed hotly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you send the letter I helped you to write?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>&ldquo;Because&mdash;because when you&rsquo;re boiling with injustice
and wicked injury&mdash;when I read it, I saw it was you and
not me. He&rsquo;d have known you wrote it, yet it was to be
my letter; so I made it mine and told him the ugly truth
about himself, which you&rsquo;d been careful not to do. According
to your letter, there was no reason why I should
leave him at all that I could see. It was that nice and
cool. But I was going to do things that you don&rsquo;t do
when you&rsquo;re nice and cool, so I told him the truth straight
out, as he deserved to hear it. It&rsquo;s no good mincing your
meaning with a man like him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You told me you&rsquo;d sent our letter, however.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t when I came to read it. It was a silly
letter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not one to go back to the past, because it&rsquo;s
generally a waste of time, Medora. It would have been
honester if you&rsquo;d told me the truth. Your letter was
pretty hot, certainly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope he found it so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He did, and unfortunately he&rsquo;s kept it. If he&rsquo;d been
wiser than he is, he&rsquo;d have burned it; instead of that he&rsquo;s
letting it burn him, if you understand me. From the look
of the letter, I should say he&rsquo;d read it a great many times
and the result is that he&rsquo;s still in a very bad frame of
mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What frame of mind did you think he&rsquo;d be in? We
can&rsquo;t all keep a hand on ourselves, like you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hoped that time enough had passed over him to
steady him. But I can&rsquo;t honestly say it has. He made
some curious remarks. I thought once he was going to
let himself go and fly at me. But I kept my eye on him
and never raised my voice. There&rsquo;s plenty of good qualities
in him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re so pleased with him,&rdquo; she said, growing
hot again. &ldquo;Naturally you think well of a man who&rsquo;s
used me so kindly!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not much pleased with him. In fact, quite the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
reverse, Medora. There&rsquo;s good in everybody&mdash;that&rsquo;s all
I mean. But he&rsquo;s got no good will to us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank God for that then!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t thank God in too much of a hurry. In a
word, he&rsquo;s going to take his own time about this business.
He&rsquo;s done nothing so far.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Done nothing!&rdquo; gasped Medora.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing whatever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my letter&mdash;the coward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have said so to you; but I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re
clever enough to see it, Medora. Yes, your letter no
doubt. You can&rsquo;t have anything for nothing in this world,
and as you gave yourself the pleasure of telling him what
you thought of him, he&rsquo;ll give himself the pleasure apparently
of making us pay for your fun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Fun&rsquo;! A lot you know about fun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You wrote what you thought would hurt; and I expect
it did hurt; and the result, so far as I can see, is a very
nasty and obstinate frame of mind in Mr. Dingle. I won&rsquo;t
tell you all he said, though he was more respectful to you
than me. But he hasn&rsquo;t done with it by a lot and he&rsquo;ll
very likely ask for heavy damages.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does that mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My money, Medora.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could he sink to that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be sinking from his point of view. It ain&rsquo;t
regarded as sinking by the law. The idea certainly hadn&rsquo;t
struck me till I heard him on the subject; but I dare say it
will happen. It&rsquo;s within his power.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t that show I said nothing in my letter he didn&rsquo;t
deserve? A man who&rsquo;d do that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Medora felt a shadow of dislike towards Jordan. It
was not the first time that any suspicion of such an alarming
sensation had coloured her thoughts before his temperate
statements and unimpassioned speeches. Was he never
to let himself go? But she fled from her impatience as
from a supreme danger. Kellock must be her hero, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
nothing. She must continue to see in him her salvation
and her tower of strength; she must let him feel and understand
the reverence, the adoration in which she held him
and his superb sacrifice on the altar of the conventions.
For such a man the things that he had done were greater
far than they had been in the case of others. He had his
future to think of as well as Medora&rsquo;s. He must not be
allowed off his pedestal in her regard for an instant. She
realised that, and perceived how her own peace of mind depended
entirely on keeping him there. Her histrionic gifts
were again to be called to her assistance.</p>

<p>Watchfully she would guard her own mind against any
doubt of Jordan&rsquo;s essential qualities. His virtue and
valour culminated, of course, in the heroism that had run
away with her and rescued her from her dragon. The only
weak and unintelligent action impartial judges might have
brought against Kellock must be to Medora his supreme
expression of masterful will and manly humanity. Even
granting his love, indifferent spectators had criticised Kellock
most for believing Medora at all, or allowing the
assurances of such a volatile person to influence him upon
such a crucial matter. His real heroism and distinction of
mind was lost upon Medora; the achievements she valued
in him belonged to his weakness of imagination and a lack
of humour destined to keep him a second class man. He
belonged to the order of whom it may be said that they
are &ldquo;great and good,&rdquo; not that they are &ldquo;great.&rdquo; But
the good qualifies&mdash;even discounts&mdash;the great.</p>

<p>While Jordan had to be supported on his pillar at any
cost if Medora&rsquo;s position was to be endurable, conversely
it was necessary to preserve her acute sense of Ned Dingle&rsquo;s
evil doing. There must be no slackening of her detestation
there; and that it now became necessary to practise a
large patience with Jordan and take no farther steps to
impress upon him her scorn of one so mean and base as
Ned, quite distracted Medora. Herein Kellock&rsquo;s composure
at first mystified her until he made clear the need for it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>&ldquo;To reasonable minds like yours and mine,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;no doubt it does appear rather improper that we should
have to be worldly wise about Mr. Dingle. But, though
the wisdom of the world is foolishness in the mind of most
clean thinking and honourable men, Medora, especially in
a case like this, yet I don&rsquo;t see that we can do anything.
We must just bend to the law and mark time, I suppose.
I don&rsquo;t go so far as to say we should demean ourselves to
cultivate Mr. Dingle and be humble to him, or anything
like that; but it&rsquo;s no good going out of the way to vex him
more than we are bound to do; because, the law, being
what it is&mdash;all on his side seemingly, we&rsquo;re more or less
powerless and quite in his hands. It&rsquo;s abominably wrong
it should be; but we&rsquo;ve got to recognise the world as it is,
and pay it the hypocrisy that virtue owes to vice sometimes.
In fact we&rsquo;ve got to keep our nerve and lie low and
wait for him. And being what he is&mdash;hard and up
against us and still smarting under what happened&mdash;he
may not be moved to do right all in a minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s making fools of us in fact&mdash;that&rsquo;s his low revenge,&rdquo;
said Medora.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He may think so in his ignorance, but he&rsquo;s wrong.
Only two people can make fools of us,&rdquo; answered Jordan,
&ldquo;and that&rsquo;s we ourselves. We&rsquo;ve took the high line and
we&rsquo;re safe accordingly. All he&rsquo;ll get out of delay is the
pangs of conscience; and what&rsquo;s more he&rsquo;ll put himself
wrong with the rest of the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s some comfort,&rdquo; said Medora. &ldquo;They smart
most who smart last, I reckon. All the same it&rsquo;s a blackguard
thing on his part.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The law moves a lot slower than human passion,&rdquo; he
explained, &ldquo;and though we say hard speeches against it,
there is some advantage in a machine that can&rsquo;t be got to
gallop as fast as man&rsquo;s hate. It may happen that, as time
goes on, he&rsquo;ll come to see that it&rsquo;s a very unmanly thing to
talk about damages, because when it comes to that, what
price the damage he inflicted on your heart and nature?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
Many a woman would have gone down under the persecution,
and it was only your own fine spirit and bed-rock
pluck and courage that kept you from doing so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Medora approved these opinions, for praise was her
favourite food, and had Kellock understood the powers of
flattery, he had always succeeded in calming her tempests
and exacting patience and obedience. But he loved her
and his love saw her in roseal light as a rule. He forgave
her little turpitudes and bitternesses and ebullitions, for
was it not natural that one who had so cruelly suffered
should sometimes betray those human weaknesses from
which none is free?</p>

<p>And for her, if the man had only been a husband to her,
nothing on earth would have shaken her resolution, or
weakened her will power. But that he was not, and her
state of widowhood proved exceedingly painful to one of
Medora&rsquo;s sanguine temperament, though this was the last
thing in her heart she could confess to Kellock. She
panted in fact for a lover sometimes; yet the consciousness
that Jordan never panted for anything of the sort made
it impossible to hint at such a human weakness.</p>

<p>She found the line of least resistance was humble surrender
to Kellock&rsquo;s high qualities. She abased her spirit
at thought of his sacrifice and really saw aright in the
question of his love for her. About that she could not
make any mistake, for she had a mind quick enough in
sundry particulars and sufficiently realised that she had
won a man who would never fail her&mdash;a tower of strength&mdash;even
though the tower threw rather a heavy shadow.
Her own nature was subdued to what it had to work in;
she wandered far from herself under these excitations.
She was, indeed, so little herself that she did not want to
be herself any more. But that ambition could not last.
She felt herself moving sometimes&mdash;the love of laughter
and pleasure, the need for stimulus, the cry for something
to anticipate with joy. There was no room for these
delights, at any rate at present, in the purview of Kellock.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
He continued solemn and staid, patient and wise, sometimes
quite inscrutable. He was magnificent, but not life&mdash;as
Medora saw life. Living with Jordan almost suggested
living in church; and church never had been Medora&rsquo;s
life, but rather an occasional interlude, depending
for its charm on the clothes she was wearing at the time.
She became a good deal depressed at this season and wept
many secret tears.</p>

<p>Then a little relaxation offered of the mildest. Mrs.
Trivett was able to report that Mary Dolbear and her
husband had forgiven Medora, and she and Kellock were
invited to tea at Priory Farm.</p>

<p>He agreed to go and assured her that here promised the
beginning of better times.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The people are coming to see the light of truth,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;You can always count on the natural good feeling
of your fellow creatures, Medora, if you&rsquo;ll only be patient
with them and give them time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They arrived upon a Sunday afternoon in Spring and
Jordan improved the occasion as they walked through the
green lanes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Spring teaches us that nothing is an end to itself,
but everything a beginning to something else,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;You realise that more in the Spring than the Summer, or
Winter, and yet it&rsquo;s just as true all the year round.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it is,&rdquo; said Medora.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so with our present situation. It&rsquo;s not complete
in itself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good Lord, no; I hope not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But just a becoming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s becoming unbearable if you ask me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; we can stand it, because our position is impregnable.
We can afford to be patient; that&rsquo;s the fine thing
about rectitude: it can always be patient. Wrong-doing
can&rsquo;t. Perhaps he&rsquo;s spoken to your mother on the subject.
If he has not, then I shall feel it will soon be my
duty to see him again, Medora.&rdquo;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>She was silent and presently, as they topped the hill and
reached the Priory ruins in Tom Dolbear&rsquo;s orchard, Jordan
spoke again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That crowing cock reminds me of something I thought
on in the night,&rdquo; he said; and Medora, glad that the ruin
had not put him in recollection of the last time they were
there, expressed interest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think a lot at night, I know,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a bird in the inn yard crowing, and I thought
how wise men are like the cock and crow in the night of
ignorance to waken up humanity. But nobody likes to be
woke up, and so they only get a frosty greeting and we
tell them to be quiet, so that we may sleep again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A very true thought, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; she answered, smothering
a yawn. Then, as they entered the orchard by a
side gate, a child or two ran to meet Medora. At tea Mrs.
Dolbear expressed tolerant opinions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I judge nobody,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;More does my husband.
I only hope you&rsquo;ll soon put it right, so as not to give evil-disposed
people the power to scoff. However, of course,
that&rsquo;s not in your power. Ned Dingle will suit his own
convenience no doubt, and you must try and bear it best
way you can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no difficulty as to that,&rdquo; declared Medora,
&ldquo;knowing we&rsquo;re in the right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You bluffed it through very well by all accounts,&rdquo; said
Tom Dolbear; &ldquo;but you can&rsquo;t defy the laws of marriage
and expect the people as a whole to feel the same to you.
However, you&rsquo;ll live it down no doubt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Medora asked her mother whether Ned had taken further
steps and Lydia did not know.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not to my knowledge,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not one to
do anything he&rsquo;ll regret. He&rsquo;s thinking of damages
against Mr. Kellock, and I believe his lawyer&rsquo;s of the same
mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is he going to leave here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When he&rsquo;s suited. Not sooner, I think.&rdquo;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>&ldquo;Knox is after his house, I hear, and has got the first
refusal for it,&rdquo; said Tom Dolbear. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a man in a
hundred&mdash;Knox, I mean. That&rsquo;s what I call a philosopher
sort of man&mdash;looks ahead and sees the future&rsquo;s only
an echo of the past. So nothing he hears surprises him.
We are very much alike in our opinions. What he wants
with a house I don&rsquo;t know, however. He may think to
marry again, which would account for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should hope Mr. Dingle would be gone pretty soon,&rdquo;
said Kellock. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bit callous him stopping, I think,
things being as they are. It would be better for all parties
if he went off in a dignified way, before the decree is pronounced.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dare say he thought it was a bit callous when you
bolted with his wife,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Dolbear. &ldquo;Least
said soonest mended, if you ask me, young man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whereupon Medora, who was nursing the new baby,
hated it suddenly and handed it back to its mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going to talk like that, Aunt Polly,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;it wasn&rsquo;t much good us coming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it was,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Dolbear, &ldquo;if only to hear
sense. You must be large-minded, or else you&rsquo;re lost, and
instead of quarrelling with everybody who thinks you&rsquo;ve
done wrong, which will take you all your time, Medora,
better be sensible and sing small and tread on nobody&rsquo;s
corns more than you can help. We&rsquo;ve forgiven you for
your dear mother&rsquo;s sake, and when you&rsquo;re married to Mr.
Kellock, you will be welcome here and treated without any
thought of the past. And so will he; and if that isn&rsquo;t
Christianity made alive, I should like to know what is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Dolbear was so pleased with her own charity that
neither Medora nor Jordan had the heart to argue about
it. Indeed argument would have been wasted on Mary&rsquo;s
intelligence. She made Medora nurse the new baby again,
and consideration of the infant occupied her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After your mother she has been called,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Dolbear, &ldquo;and her name&rsquo;s the brightest thing about her so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
far. She&rsquo;s healthy and seems to have a live and let live
sort of nature.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s got lovely blue eyes,&rdquo; said Medora.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll fade, however,&rdquo; explained her aunt. &ldquo;Most
of my children have blue eyes to start with, but it ain&rsquo;t a
fast colour and can&rsquo;t stand the light. If you look at my
husband&rsquo;s eyes, you&rsquo;ll see they be a very pale, washed-out
blue; and the children mostly take after him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lydia, her daughter and Mr. Kellock presently went for
a walk before supper. As a treat, Billy, Milly, Clara and
Jenny Dolbear accompanied them, and Tom himself started
with the party. But he disappeared at the &ldquo;Man and
Gun,&rdquo; and they proceeded alone to the churchyard, that
Lydia might put some flowers on a new-made grave.</p>

<p>The evening light brought out detail in the great grey
tower above them. Seed of fern had found the ledges and
run little lines of dim green along them. Over the battlements
a white image of a cock hung for weather-vane.
The churchyard extended so that the evening sun flung the
shadows of the gravestones upon neighbour mounds, and
Mrs. Trivett pointed this out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All his life long Noah Peeke darkened his daughter&rsquo;s
life,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and now you see his slate flings a shadow
on her grave, poor woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She put her nosegay on the raw-grass-clods built up
over the sleeping place of Miss Peeke, and removed some
dead flowers. Then they climbed the hill and extended
their ramble with the children running on before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My friend, Nancy Peeke, was father-ridden,&rdquo; explained
Lydia. &ldquo;She sacrificed herself to her widowed
father, and though a good few offered for her, she never
left him. He reigned over her like a proper tyrant, but
he never saw what he was doing and wasn&rsquo;t grateful to the
day she closed her eyes. By that time it was too late to
do much herself; and he ruled from the grave you may say,
because up to her last illness, what her father would have
done was always the ruling passion in her. It worked un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>consciously;
but it worked. He ruined her life so far as
we can say it. However, she&rsquo;s at peace now. Death&rsquo;s
only a King of Terrors to the living. He can&rsquo;t fright her
no more&mdash;nor her father can&rsquo;t neither.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take care people don&rsquo;t say the same of you,&rdquo; warned
Medora. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re Aunt Polly&rsquo;s drudge at present, and
many people know it quite well and think it a shameful
thing at your age&mdash;nobody more than Mr. Knox; and
when Jordan understands about it, he&rsquo;ll protest as much
as I do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Mrs. Trivett never allowed conversation personal to
herself if she could prevent it.</p>

<p>Now she challenged Kellock, who had been very silent,
and made him talk.</p>

<small>PHILANDER&rsquo;S FATE</small></h2></div>


<p>Medora&rsquo;s mother found increasing matter for agitation in
the attitude of Ned Dingle. She had seen him twice and
urged the need of action. She had even offered to give
him all her small savings towards the legal cost of the
operation. And then he had startled and shocked her a
good deal by two statements, neither of which Lydia had
expected.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All in good time,&rdquo; he had said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel any
particular call to hurry myself on their account. Plenty
of time when I&rsquo;ve settled my new job. As to the cost, it
would be particular hard if you, of all people, was called
to part on such a subject, and I wouldn&rsquo;t allow it for a
moment. But when I do start on to it, my lawyer thinks
I can bring a pretty hot case against Kellock for damages;
so I dare say I shall knock expenses out of him, and a bit
over. And the harder his savings are hit, the better every
right thinking person will be pleased.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he had spoken, and two days later had disappeared
from Ashprington, and left no direction behind him.
Where he was gone and whether he would return, none
knew. Kellock deplored the delay and Medora bitterly
resented it. She was very unhappy and her troubles now
occupied her mother&rsquo;s mind. Mrs. Trivett felt chiefly concerned
to approach Ned Dingle again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he&rsquo;s down Ivybridge way, at the paper mills there,
I might go and see him,&rdquo; she said to Philander Knox in the
luncheon hour; but Mr. Knox either could not or would not
assist Lydia to find her son-in-law.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where he&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
shouldn&rsquo;t worry in that matter, because you can&rsquo;t alter it,
or turn Ned Dingle from his plans, whatever they may be.
On the whole, I should back him to do the fair thing in his
own time. You can&rsquo;t expect him to go out of his way for
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He wants to punish them seemingly,&rdquo; said Lydia.
&ldquo;He told me the harder Kellock was hit, the better people
would be pleased. In fact he&rsquo;s getting a bit of his own
back, I suppose, or thinks he is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In this case, it&rsquo;s all or none,&rdquo; answered Mr. Knox.
&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t get a bit of his own back, and he can&rsquo;t call it
his own if it&rsquo;s ceased to be his own. The subject&rsquo;s wrapped
in mystery, Lydia Trivett, and only time will hatch what&rsquo;s
really in Ned&rsquo;s mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He oughtn&rsquo;t to keep them on tenterhooks like this,&rdquo;
she said; but Philander felt no call to criticise Mr. Dingle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll suit himself, and why not? I&rsquo;ve given him a bit
of useful advice. Whether he&rsquo;ll take it or not I can&rsquo;t of
course, say; but don&rsquo;t you fret, that&rsquo;s all. Medora&rsquo;s broke
up a bit, I fancy. She&rsquo;s just beginning to see in a dim
sort of way she&rsquo;s not everybody. Being your daughter,
I&rsquo;m willing to offer friendship; but if she&rsquo;s going to thrust
me out of your thoughts, then she&rsquo;ll have one more enemy
than she&rsquo;s got at present, I warn you of that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t talk so, my dear man, if you please,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Trivett. &ldquo;My daughter&rsquo;s affairs and your affairs
are two different things, and you needn&rsquo;t fear I&rsquo;m forgetting
all you&rsquo;ve told me. You must let me have the full
fortnight I bargained for last week. But you&rsquo;re on my
mind too&mdash;working underground like a mole&mdash;and
though I may not exactly see you at it, there&rsquo;s the marks
of you. In fact I do think of you a lot, and if it&rsquo;s any
comfort to you, I&rsquo;ve dreamed of you once or twice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In a friendly way, I hope?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite friendly. We was shopping in a great shop,
and I was carrying a lot of parcels.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe in dreams,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Give me real<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>ity,
and make up your mind. Above all things don&rsquo;t be
influenced against me by&mdash;well, you know. That&rsquo;s where
the danger lies, in my opinion, and you&rsquo;ll be going under
your character if you let sentiment and silliness and a
barrow-load of other people&rsquo;s children come between you
and your duty to yourself&mdash;not to mention me. Because
I warn you, Lydia, that the grand mistake you make is
that you forget your duty to yourself. A lot of good
Christians do that; though your duty to yourself is quite
as much a part of righteousness as your duty to your
neighbour. We&rsquo;re told to love our neighbour as ourselves,
I believe, not better. And there&rsquo;s another side; by doing
that woman&rsquo;s work, and coming between her and the lawful
consequences of that litter of children, you&rsquo;re not doing
her any good, but harm. You&rsquo;re ruining her character,
and helping her to live a lazy life. You&rsquo;ve taught her and
your brother to take you as an every-day creature, and all
as much in the course of nature as their daily bread,
whereas the truth is that you are that rare thing, an angel
in the house, and your qualities are clean hidden from their
stupid eyes. It&rsquo;s making a couple naturally selfish, ten
times more so; and that&rsquo;s what you unselfish people bring
about so often as not. You toil and moil and work your
fingers to the bone doing your duty, as you think, when
half the time you&rsquo;re only doing somebody else&rsquo;s duty.
And what&rsquo;s the result? You&rsquo;re not even respected for it.
You&rsquo;re taken for granted&mdash;that&rsquo;s all the reward you get&mdash;you&rsquo;re
taken for granted&mdash;never a nice thing at best.
And I tell you that you&rsquo;re up against justice to me and
yourself, Lydia. For though we&rsquo;ve not known each other
a year yet, there&rsquo;s that in our natures that belongs to each
other. It would be a very proper thing to happen, and
we should be teaching your brother&rsquo;s family a very simple
but valuable lesson, which is that to have anything for
nothing in this world is robbery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All as true as true,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I never find myself
questioning your sense, and I quite admit there&rsquo;s often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
nobody so properly selfish as your unselfish sort. I&rsquo;ve
seen them play the mischief with other people&rsquo;s lives, and
create a very mistaken state of security in other people&rsquo;s
houses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Once grasp that, and I shall live in hope,&rdquo; said Philander.
&ldquo;Let each man do his own work is a very good
rule, because if you&rsquo;re always helping others, there&rsquo;s a tidy
chance your own job&rsquo;s not being properly done; and
though you might argue that your own work here isn&rsquo;t
hurt by what you do at Priory Farm, it&rsquo;s quite possible
that other work is hurt. I mean the time for thought and
self-improvement, and&mdash;in fact, me. For I&rsquo;ve a fair call
upon your time under the present conditions, and though
it&rsquo;s all right for Mrs. Dolbear to know you&rsquo;re putting
years on to your life before you&rsquo;ve lived them, it isn&rsquo;t all
right for your true friends to hear about; and it isn&rsquo;t all
right for your Maker, Who certainly never intended you
for a nurse-maid at fifty odd years of age&mdash;or for a rag-sorter,
either. You&rsquo;re ripe for higher things, and there&rsquo;s
independence and peace waiting for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to think of it,&rdquo; said Lydia. &ldquo;For many
reasons I&rsquo;d like it, Philander Knox. You suit me very
well, because you&rsquo;ve got sense and character, and we seem
to think alike in a lot that matters. You&rsquo;ve made me fond
of you, and I trust you. In fact, there&rsquo;s such a lot that
looks promising about it, that, for that reason, one can&rsquo;t
help mistrusting it. Life teaches anybody to doubt the
bright side of a thing till you&rsquo;ve weighed it fairly against
the dark side.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This hasn&rsquo;t got no dark side,&rdquo; he declared; &ldquo;and if
you&rsquo;re honest, the longer you look at it, the brighter it
will shine. So be fair to us both. Trust your own brain-power;
I can&rsquo;t give you better advice than that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She promised, and that evening, though she had hardly
meant to be so prompt, Lydia raised the question among
her relations. Accident led to this, and threw so forcible
a commentary on the conversation with Mr. Knox, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
matter sprang to her lips unsummoned, and surprised herself.
Yet voiced in the kitchen of Priory Farm, from behind
a pile of the children&rsquo;s mending, Lydia&rsquo;s tremendous
statement struck even herself as almost impossibly shocking
and heartless.</p>

<p>Jenny had just suffered from an attack of croup and
Lydia, of course, took the sick child into her own room,
as Tom Dolbear would not let Mary do so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must have my night&rsquo;s rest, or else I can&rsquo;t do my day&rsquo;s
work,&rdquo; he said, and his wife agreed with him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know Lydia will take Jenny, won&rsquo;t you, dear Lydia?
Jenny&rsquo;s that fond of you, too. And there&rsquo;s no peace for
me and Tom like the peace when the childer are along with
you. Because then we know they&rsquo;re put first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This evening Jenny would not go to sleep and Lydia had
run up and down stairs once or twice. Then she went into
a room where Milly and Clara slept&mdash;to find them also
awake and clamouring for biscuits. Having fed and silenced
them, she returned to the pile of mending.</p>

<p>It was a rough, wet night and Mr. Dolbear sat and
smoked by the fire, while his wife drowsed on the other side
of the hearth. The last baby was asleep in its cradle near
her.</p>

<p>Tom told of a successful stroke at Totnes market and
was pleased with himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The year&rsquo;s begun well,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t one to count
my chickens before they&rsquo;re hatched, but I never had such
lambs in my life and the quality&rsquo;s as high as the numbers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And no more than you deserve,&rdquo; said his wife; &ldquo;rewards
come where they are due, and such a man as you did
ought to be looked after. Oh, dear&mdash;there&rsquo;s Jenny again,
I&rsquo;m afraid, Lydia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Trivett departed a third time and presently returned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A little bit of temper, I&rsquo;m afraid. She&rsquo;s crying out
for an orange to suck, and that&rsquo;s the last thing she can
have.&rdquo;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t call it temper,&rdquo; argued Jenny&rsquo;s mother.
&ldquo;No child of mine have got what you&rsquo;d call temper,
Lydia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where we don&rsquo;t agree then,&rdquo; answered her
sister-in-law. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fond of Jenny, as you well know; but
what she&rsquo;s got to fight against is temper, in my opinion.
We mustn&rsquo;t spoil her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If that happens, it won&rsquo;t be me, nor yet her father
that does the harm,&rdquo; declared Mary placidly. &ldquo;Where
children come, you&rsquo;ll generally find that wisdom is sent to
manage them, and I do think that Tom and me know something
about how to manage our own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so long ago since you had your daughter to bring
up, that very like you&rsquo;ve forgotten the early stages,
Lydia,&rdquo; suggested Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And in any case, though God knows I&rsquo;d never have
whispered it to you if you hadn&rsquo;t said Jenny suffered from
temper&mdash;in any case, when you look at Medora, you can&rsquo;t
be none too sure your way of upbringing was the best,&rdquo;
murmured Mrs. Dolbear.</p>

<p>Mrs. Trivett smiled to herself and threaded another
needle. She knew Mary very well and was not in the least
concerned for this little flash. It meant nothing whatever.
Mary was a worm who only wriggled if one of her progeny
was trodden on. There was another shout from Jenny
and Lydia took no notice, while both Tom and Mary looked
at her inquiringly.</p>

<p>Then she spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never like to trouble you people about my own
affairs, because, naturally, you&rsquo;ve got no time to think
about a humble person like me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that, Lydia,&rdquo; said her brother. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t you
one of us and ain&rsquo;t our good your good?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; but it&rsquo;s borne in on me, Tom, we can&rsquo;t live for
other people. I&rsquo;ve got my own life to live too. I&rsquo;ve got
my work, and I earn my living just as much as you
do.&rdquo;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>&ldquo;Meanwhile that sick child&rsquo;s yowling her head off,&rdquo; said
Mary sadly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She said she hated me last time I went up, so I can&rsquo;t
go up again,&rdquo; declared Mrs. Trivett, &ldquo;not till she&rsquo;s
asleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A child&rsquo;s a child,&rdquo; replied the mother, &ldquo;and if you&rsquo;re
going to take that line about &rsquo;em&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She rose ponderously and lumbered from the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve hurt her feelings,&rdquo; grumbled Tom. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
the matter with you this evening, Lydia? If anybody&rsquo;s
vexed you, best to have it out and not sulk over it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Funny I should be in hot water with you and Polly to-night,&rdquo;
answered Mrs. Trivett. &ldquo;But you ought to
choose your words cleverer, Tom. I don&rsquo;t sulk, my dear,
whatever my faults.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I stand corrected,&rdquo; answered Mr. Dolbear instantly.
&ldquo;God knows I&rsquo;ve no wish to quarrel with you, Lydia&mdash;no,
nor would Polly. We&rsquo;ve got a great respect for you. As
for our children&mdash;but you know what you are to them.
And we feel that nothing&rsquo;s too good for you; and if I
could afford to let you live here without paying your
seven and six-pence a week, I&rsquo;d thankfully let you&mdash;thankfully.
But with such a family as mine&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For some things, however, if you had a paid woman to
look after the children, it might suit their mother better.
She&rsquo;d feel freer to speak her mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want no
hirelings about the children&mdash;not while we&rsquo;ve got you.
We couldn&rsquo;t trust anybody like we trust you; and Polly
would never be the same woman, or get her needful share
of rest and peace with a lesser than you. And some day,
I hope to make you free of everything, and not let any
money question arise between us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not worrying about my keep, Tom. Whatever
else he may be, Jordan Kellock has got a very good respect
of me, and though I shall never like him as well as Ned,
yet he&rsquo;s an honourable, upright man according to his lights<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
and I can trust him. Indeed he&rsquo;s gone so far as to say
he&rsquo;d like me to lead a different life; for he&rsquo;s the same as
Dingle there: he doesn&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a very wise thing for an
elderly woman to be quite so busy as I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like his damned impertinence! And what does he
mean by that, Priory Farm, or the Mill?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Dolbear returned at this moment; she was fretful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whatever you&rsquo;ve done to Jenny. A
proper tantarra the poor maid&rsquo;s in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told her she couldn&rsquo;t have another orange to-night,
that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen to this!&rdquo; burst out Tom. &ldquo;That blasted Kellock
has been saying Lydia&rsquo;s over-worked!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who by?&rdquo; asked his wife.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I want to know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he means the Mill, he&rsquo;s right, I believe,&rdquo; continued
Mary. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve often wished she&rsquo;d see her way to give up
that troublesome work in the rag house and stop here with
us, in comfort and ease, with our little ones to play with
her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or I might marry again and have a home of my own,&rdquo;
suggested Lydia. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the independent sort, Mary, and
I often think it would be wiser to do that than stop along
with you as a lodger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a moment of silence, then Mr. Dolbear flung
his clay pipe upon the hearth with such fury that it splintered
into a thousand fragments.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What in hell&rsquo;s happened to-day?&rdquo; he almost shouted.
&ldquo;Here I come home with good news&mdash;great news, you
may say&mdash;and instead of sharing our pleasure and being
glad, for the children&rsquo;s sake if not for ours, that I&rsquo;ve had
a stroke of luck, you do every damned thing you can think
of to pour cold water on it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Tom, don&rsquo;t be a fool,&rdquo; answered Lydia
calmly. &ldquo;You and Polly are getting so wrapped up in
number one, that you can&rsquo;t imagine anybody having any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
interest or thought outside this house and the welfare of
you and your children. But the world goes on outside
Priory Farm, and I say again, it&rsquo;s come to be a question
with me whether I&rsquo;m doing the best I can do in the world
by stopping here. A question of duty, mind. I may tell
you both that some very straight things have been spoke
to me of late, and I can&rsquo;t pretend they haven&rsquo;t got a lot of
truth in &rsquo;em&mdash;perhaps more than the man who spoke them
thought. For looking back, as I have a good bit since this
business of Medora, I see only too bitter clear that it&rsquo;s
possible to be too unselfish and to spoil young folk and
unfit them for the battle of life by coming between them
and their duty. That&rsquo;s what I did with Medora, as you
reminded me just now, Polly, and that&rsquo;s my inclination
with your little ones; and I&rsquo;m growing very doubtful if I&rsquo;m
not thinking of my own inclinations, or personal desires,
more than what&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Either you&rsquo;re mad, Lydia, or you&rsquo;ve been talking to
somebody that&rsquo;s mad,&rdquo; declared Tom furiously. &ldquo;This
is about the most shattering speech I&rsquo;ve ever heard from
you, and for cruelty and unreason I never heard the like.
Look at my wife&mdash;ain&rsquo;t that enough? If she&rsquo;d seen a
spectrum, she couldn&rsquo;t have gone whiter in the gills&mdash;and
her chin&rsquo;s dropped and all her teeth showing. And if
such a shock ain&rsquo;t enough to turn her milk sour and poison
that baby, then I&rsquo;m a fool.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Indeed Mrs. Dolbear had changed colour and did look
extremely frightened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know what you&rsquo;re hinting at, Lydia,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and
I can only tell you if you was to do such a thing as to leave
your brother at a time like this, after you&rsquo;d practically
promised to help me with his family&mdash;if you were to go
on some selfish pretext and marry some creature and lose
your comfortable home and your fame for sense&mdash;if you
did that, you&rsquo;d never have another peaceful moment from
your conscience.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;d never deserve to have one,&rdquo; added Tom.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
&ldquo;Looked at on high grounds, Lydia, it don&rsquo;t bear thinking
on for a second, and well you know it. Bring your
religion to bear on it, woman, and you&rsquo;ll feel a good pinch
of shame, I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m doing, if you could see it,&rdquo; answered
Lydia. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a matter for religion, so far, and the
welfare of the young folk. I&rsquo;m thinking for them and
their characters. It would be a poor come-along-of-it,
Tom, if years hence you and Polly was to turn round and
say that I had marred your children&rsquo;s natures.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re the best judge of that,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;And if
we&rsquo;re satisfied with your way of handling the children,
whose business is it to put all these wicked ideas in your
head? God&rsquo;s truth! I never heard of such impudence.
And you, at your age&mdash;as if you didn&rsquo;t know what was
duty and what was not. Perhaps &rsquo;tis thought you spoil us
as well as our children, and give everything and get nothing
in exchange?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He snorted with indignation when Lydia admitted that
this was actually the case.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some do think so for that matter,&rdquo; she confessed.</p>

<p>Her brother honestly felt this to be an undeserved blow.
He had built up a very different picture of Lydia&rsquo;s existence
and believed that her privileges at Priory Farm at
least balanced any advantages that accrued from her presence.
This, however, was what Mary understood very
much better than Tom. She dwelt under no delusion on
the subject and fully appreciated the significance of her
sister-in-law in the cosmic scheme.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the sort of thing outsiders say and you believe,
then the sooner you&rsquo;re gone from my roof, the better
pleased I shall be,&rdquo; shouted Mr. Dolbear. &ldquo;I was under
the impression that after your husband died, Lydia, you
turned to me for comfort and put me first henceforth, and
felt that this was a blessed haven for your middle age.
But, of course, if I&rsquo;m wrong and you&rsquo;re only a slave and
I&rsquo;m only a slave-driver, then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>He stopped, for Mary did an uncommon thing and suddenly
burst into an explosion of noisy tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; said Mr. Dolbear tragically, &ldquo;look at your
work!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t Lydia,&rdquo; wept the other, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s you. I never
was so cut to the heart in all my life, and I can&rsquo;t stand
much more of it. Lydia&rsquo;s as much a part of this house as
the door handles, and dearer to me, next to my children and
you, than anything on God&rsquo;s earth; and when you talk of
her going away from us, you might as well talk of cutting
off my leg. We&rsquo;re three in one and one in three, you and
Lydia and me, and the man or woman who came between
us would be doing the devil&rsquo;s work and ought to be treated
according.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a heart!&rdquo; said Mr. Dolbear. &ldquo;If that ain&rsquo;t
offering the other cheek, Lydia&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; continued Mary, drying her eyes, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s some
sorrows I could face, if it was the will of God, but the
sorrow of living my life without Lydia&rsquo;s wisdom and help,
and the light of her countenance&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t do it. I
wouldn&rsquo;t be responsible. I know all she is in this house,
and though you in your manly way&mdash;which is to be
annoyed when you get a surprise you don&rsquo;t like&mdash;though
you, Tom, may foolishly think Priory Farm could go on
without Lydia, that only shows the gulf there&rsquo;s fixed between
the male and female mind. I know Lydia&rsquo;s the lynch
pin to our cart, and so do my girls, down to that innocent
infant in the cradle, if she could talk; and so do Lydia
herself, for though modest as a violet, she&rsquo;s far too witty
to misunderstand a thing like that. And if I thought
any evil influence was upon Lydia to make her restless, I&rsquo;d
go on my knees to God to touch her heart and keep it in
the old pattern; and I&rsquo;d stop on &rsquo;em till He had.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here Mary wept again and Tom, impressed by so much
emotion, moderated his warmth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I said anything over and above, I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; he
declared. &ldquo;But when I get a shock, it nearly always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
loosens my tongue; and to think that evil disposed persons
have been poisoning Lydia&rsquo;s mind against her own is a bit
beyond reason and justice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we&rsquo;re falling short in our duty and undervaluing
you, Lydia, you must tell us,&rdquo; added Mary, &ldquo;for we&rsquo;re not
the sort to fail in gratitude I should hope. We may not
voice our thanks; but God knows if they&rsquo;re in our prayers
or not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Lydia spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing like that. It&rsquo;s only a natural difference
of opinion. There&rsquo;s a man wants to marry me, and he
can&rsquo;t be blamed, looking at me from his romantical point
of view, for thinking he&rsquo;d like to see me in my own home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Heavy silence followed, and only a cricket behind the
oven broke it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dolbear&rsquo;s heart sank. She was prepared to go to
any possible extremes of conduct rather than lose Lydia.
Without Mrs. Trivett, her own life must inevitably become
a far more complicated and strenuous matter than she
desired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not for us to advise you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but I hope
the Almighty will help you out of temptation, Lydia, for
anything more dreadful and unbecoming than that couldn&rsquo;t
happen to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dare say you&rsquo;re right, Mary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t tell you this for selfishness, nor yet because
you&rsquo;d leave a house of mourners and break a lot of young,
innocent hearts, if you was to go. I tell you this, because
I do believe your high nature wouldn&rsquo;t brook another man,
or return into the wedded state with comfort after all
these widowed years of freedom. I can&rsquo;t see you happy
so; and I can&rsquo;t see any nice man wishing to take you out
of this house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lydia rose to retire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As to that, Polly, it&rsquo;s all the point of view. Nobody
can fairly quarrel with the man. He&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I hope you don&rsquo;t think of it all the same,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
after hearing my wife, Lydia,&rdquo; murmured Tom, now subdued.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must think of it. I owe it to him. I&rsquo;m sorry you
can&rsquo;t trust a woman of my age to behave sensibly; but I
dare say that&rsquo;s natural. Only be sure I&rsquo;ve no wish to give
either of you a pang. You know what I think of you and
the children, and how happy I&rsquo;ve been to see them come
into the world so full of promise and hope. And if you
look back, Polly, you&rsquo;ll see I&rsquo;ve always tried to be on the
side of discipline and sense, and never lost a chance to
strengthen your hand and win all proper obedience for
you and Tom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We know all that,&rdquo; answered her brother. &ldquo;You
mustn&rsquo;t think because I&rsquo;m a man of slow speech that my
heart&rsquo;s slow likewise. Far from it. I like for everything
to go smooth and peaceful; I hate change; and if changes
are coming, all I can say is I haven&rsquo;t deserved &rsquo;em and
more&rsquo;s my poor wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good night, Lydia. God bless you,&rdquo; said Mary, mopping
her eyes. Then Mrs. Trivett left them and retired
to the peace of her own sanctum. It was true that Jenny
at present shared this ark, but Jenny had at last gone to
sleep and Lydia meditated without interruption about her
future.</p>

<p>She came to a preliminary conclusion that, for once,
duty was not directly involved. It seemed at a first glance
that her own inclination might reasonably be considered,
and that no choice between right and wrong awaited her.
To marry was a very reasonable step, whatever Mary
might say, for she was not old, and Mr. Knox could be
trusted to make a worthy spouse and treat her with all
due respect and consideration. She liked him and felt it
quite possible to share his life and devote herself to his
comfort and welfare. But to refuse him would be no more
difficult than to accept him. Her present life, that looked
so grey seen from the outside, was agreeable enough to her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
She loved work and she loved children, especially her
brother&rsquo;s children. She had been largely responsible for
their up-bringing and they owed much to her. Moreover
they loved her quite as much as their mother. Indeed she
was the sun to their mother&rsquo;s moon, and she very well
knew what a disaster her departure must be in the eyes of
Milly and Bobby, Jenny and Clara.</p>

<p>Nor could she well see her own life separated from theirs.
She had not decided when she went to sleep, but there was
little doubt in her subconscious mind as to how she would
decide. Mary&rsquo;s attitude had also influenced her. The
real terror in Mary&rsquo;s eyes, when the threat of departure
broke upon her, Lydia could not easily forget. She dwelt
on these things and did not allow her sister-in-law&rsquo;s craft,
or her brother&rsquo;s anger and selfishness to influence her.</p>

<p>As for Mr. and Mrs. Dolbear, they lay awake till dawn,
racking their brains to devise means by which Lydia might
be preserved alive to them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One thing&rsquo;s certain in my mind,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;We
know the man; and that ought to be a tower of strength.
There&rsquo;s no doubt it&rsquo;s Philander Knox, and all his sucking
up to us and pretended friendship is now explained.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must get at him&mdash;for Lydia&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; declared
Mary. &ldquo;She shan&rsquo;t be trapped to her doom by an unknown
creature like that if I can prevent it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s surely something beastly to the man,&rdquo; asserted
Tom, &ldquo;otherwise, after he&rsquo;d once seen what my sister was
in this house, he&rsquo;d have understood it was a vain and selfish
plot to try and get her out of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s always talking about the greatest good to the
greatest number,&rdquo; added Mary, &ldquo;and now &rsquo;tis for her to
practise what she preaches. Here there&rsquo;s ten want her;
and is one doubtful male, come from Lord knows where, to
count against all her nearest and dearest? God forbid!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I hope she&rsquo;ll see it like that; and if she don&rsquo;t, we
must make it our business to queer that man&rsquo;s pitch. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
you and me, working heart and soul for our children and
the family in general, can&rsquo;t get this foreigner on the run,
we&rsquo;re not what I think we are.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gap-20"></div>

<p>Next morning Mary was far too indisposed to rise, and
before she went to work, Lydia took her up a cup of tea
and three slices of toast and butter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve decided, Mary,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and if it&rsquo;s any comfort
to you to know it, I may tell you that I shall stop here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whereupon Mary wept again, held Mrs. Trivett&rsquo;s hand
and kissed it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blessed be your name,&rdquo; she gurgled, &ldquo;and may God&rsquo;s
reward meet the case, Lydia. I&rsquo;d give you all the kingdoms
of earth if they was mine.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI<br />

<small>THE PROTEST</small></h2></div>


<p>At one end of the glazing house&mdash;a lofty and bright
workroom at the top story of the Mill&mdash;stood the dry
press, to which the choice papers demanding extra finish
came after glazing. Here they were piled between heavy
slabs of hot metal and subject to great pressure; but the
primal business of glazing had already been done between
metal rollers. A range of these presented the principal
object in this workshop.</p>

<p>Girls prepared the paper for the rollers, and Medora
had once been of this cheerful and busy throng. Hither
came the paper from its final drying after the size bath, and
the workers stood with a heap of sheets on one side of them
and a little stack of polished zinc plates on the other.
With her left hand each girl snatched a sheet of paper,
with her right a plate of zinc; and then she inter-leaved the
paper with the metal until a good wad rose in her crib.
The paper was now ready for the glazing rollers, and men,
who tended these massive machines, ran the sheets and
zinc wads between the steel rollers, backward and forward
twice and thrice under tremendous strain. Then what was
dim and lustreless reappeared with a bright and shining
surface, and the sheets returned again to the girls, who
separated zinc and paper once more.</p>

<p>Mr. Pinhey had often preached on this text&mdash;indeed his
simile was worn threadbare, though he repeated it to every
new-comer in the glazing house and rolling room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With paper as with humans,&rdquo; he would say, &ldquo;nothing
like a sharp pinch to bring out the polish; that is if a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
man&rsquo;s built of stuff good enough to take a polish. Of
course some are not; we know that only too well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The distinctive sounds in this great shop were three and
did he hear them, a paper maker with his eyes shut would
know exactly where he was. First, the steady thud of the
plates on the side of the wooden cribs; next, the ceaseless
rustle and hiss of the paper flying between the girl&rsquo;s hands
as it is laid upon the zinc or snatched off it; and lastly
the rumble of the rolling machines sounding a bass as they
grip the piles of paper and metal and squeeze them up and
down.</p>

<p>The very precious papers went to the dry press; but
the mass of them passed directly to the sorters, who graded
all stock into three qualities&mdash;perfect, less perfect, and
inferior. No inferior paper ever left Dene Mill. It was
pulped again; but could not aspire to the highest standard
having once sunk beneath it.</p>

<p>And lastly it came to Mr. Pinhey&mdash;the finisher&mdash;who
seemed a figure conceived and planned for this lofty purpose.
Spick and span in his snowy apron, with delicate
hands and quick eyes behind their shining glasses, he moved
spotless through the mountains and masses of the finished
article; he passed amid the ordered blocks magisterially&mdash;a
very spirit of purity who reigned over the reams and
called them by their names. Wove and laid Imperial,
Super-royal, Medium, Demy, Foolscap and Double Foolscap
were all included. Here towered orange and old rose
sections; here azure and ultramarine; here sea green, here
opaline pink and every delicate shade of buff and cream, to
the snowy whiteness of the great papers and mightiest
sheets. From fairy note to &ldquo;double elephant&rdquo; ranged
Mr. Pinhey&rsquo;s activity. He worked among the papers,
great and small, and put the last touch of perfection and
completeness before they passed away into the larger
world.</p>

<p>But to-day Nicholas was concerned with a little affair
outside the province of the finisher. On a sheet of palest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
pink, a sheet that seemed actually itself to blush at the
delicacy of its task, Mr. Pinhey had written a few sentences
in his happiest manner and was handing it round the
shop, that men and women might set their names thereto.
He told everybody that he much disliked such an appeal
and protest, but that his sense of propriety made it necessary,
for conscience sake, to proceed. He was honest in
this assurance and did not deceive himself. Some of his
co-workers, who declined to sign, thought that Mr. Pinhey
was conducting his cathartic mission from private motives,
not of the highest, and frankly told him so; but they
were wrong. The man steadfastly believed that religion
demanded his action. He had debated the problem for
many weeks and at last come to the conclusion that a
strong step must be taken.</p>

<p>The fact that Jordan Kellock should continue to earn
his living at Dene Mill, while he lived in sin out of it, had
become a mental possession with Mr. Pinhey. He believed
that such a situation must be an active challenge to
Providence, a perpetual blister to the Everlasting Intelligence
on Whose watchful keeping that human hive depended.
It seemed to Nicholas that this negation of right
could not go on for ever, and he presently convinced himself
that what appeared to be nobody&rsquo;s business, was in
reality everybody&rsquo;s business. He suspected that many of
the more sober and God-fearing agreed with him, and he
knew that, so far as the glazing house was concerned, the
majority always agreed as a matter of course with his
views. Only the irreligious or low-minded ever questioned
him, and when they had committed that error, he did not
rest until he had got them out of his department.</p>

<p>And now he had drafted an appeal to Mr. Trenchard
and was procuring all possible signatures for it.</p>

<p>It began &ldquo;We the undersigned,&rdquo; and it expressed a
pious conviction that the presence of Jordan Kellock in
the vat house was a source of danger to the prosperity of
the Mill, and a threat to the spiritual stability of younger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
people, who would see in his support and encouragement
an indication that morals counted for less than professional
ability and that skill and craft were rated higher
than a right way of living and scrupulous obedience to
Divine precept.</p>

<p>He was pleased with the composition, but took no credit
to himself. He felt that his hand had been guided when
he wrote it, and believed that every word was in the right
place by a direct act of inspiration. And now he desired
the largest number of signatures possible&mdash;from the
heads of departments for choice. Unhappily there were
strong forces opposed to Nicholas and he knew that not
only would the foreman, Ernest Trood, refuse to sign, but
he might influence others against so doing. Neither could
Medora&rsquo;s mother be easily approached, though she had
always represented a force for good. He decided, however,
to invite Lydia&rsquo;s opinion. She could at least see the
other side, and Mr. Pinhey felt that she would not misunderstand
a man of his repute if he discussed the painful
subject on the plane where he habitually moved. For he,
too, very constantly spoke of &ldquo;moving on a plane,&rdquo; even
as the unregenerate Kellock was used to do. Indeed, they
had no little in common&mdash;a fact that came to Mr. Pinhey&rsquo;s
shocked ear on this identical day.</p>

<p>During the dinner hour, fountain-pen in hand, Nicholas
proceeded upon his task, nerved thereto by most exalted
sentiments. The certainties all signed with gusto; but
among the doubtful attestors, Mr. Pinhey was disappointed
to find few prepared to support him. Lydia he
approached, where she sat reading a newspaper in her
workroom. Indeed her thoughts were far from the printed
page, but she opened it from force of habit until the work
bell rang again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll thank you to read this, Mrs. Trivett,&rdquo; said Nicholas,
as he presented his blushing manifesto. &ldquo;You may
for a moment doubt whether I ought to ask you, of all
people, to sign it. I&rsquo;ve been advised not. But we&rsquo;re old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
friends, I believe, and I know you&rsquo;ll never quarrel with the
man who does his duty, even if you don&rsquo;t see his duty with
the same eyes as him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Duty&rsquo;s often a doubtful matter,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and we
mistake inclination for duty sometimes. You can easily
hoodwink yourself about duty, Nicholas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She read the protest and gave it back to him and shook
her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do as you think right,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t ask me
to sign that. You&rsquo;ll guess without being told what a sad
thing this is for a mother; but I&rsquo;m not going to take sides
this time of day. I&rsquo;ve told them what I think about it and
how I&rsquo;ve suffered over it, and I&rsquo;ve told other people also;
but there&rsquo;s nothing gained that I can see by this. There&rsquo;s
more in it than meets the eye, and Jordan Kellock is the
sort of man to feel the punishment of his own conscience
much sharper than the voice, or vote, of his fellow men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Conscience!&rsquo;&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Pinhey. &ldquo;How can
you say that the man who does a thing like that have got
a conscience, Mrs. Trivett?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I know he has&mdash;so do you if you&rsquo;ll think.
There&rsquo;s very few so fussy and nice about life and its duties
and bearings as Jordan Kellock. We all know what he is;
and until this happened, nobody respected him more than
you. And now he&rsquo;s done a thing that your conscience and
mine don&rsquo;t approve. But remember this, he&rsquo;d never have
done it if his own conscience hadn&rsquo;t supported him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was the devil getting the better of his conscience,&rdquo;
argued Nicholas. &ldquo;He was always weak, because he was
self-righteous, though Lord knows, seeing his foggy religious
opinions, none had less reason to be. He had got
his own theory of morals seemingly, and since it didn&rsquo;t
come out of the Word, it was worthless as you&rsquo;d expect.
So when the trial came and your daughter&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leave it, there&rsquo;s a good man. I&rsquo;m not going to argue
upon it. I hope they&rsquo;ll soon be properly married and this
sad business allowed to pass by and be forgot. For the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
minute it&rsquo;s up to Ned Dingle, and I&rsquo;ve been bitter sorry
for him, and he knows all I think about it; but there&rsquo;s no
more can be done to right the wrong and ease people who
feel like you, till Ned does it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your heart is speaking against your morals, Lydia, if
I may say so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may say what you like, of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t rise to the thought that it is painful for
some of us to earn our living under the same roof as that
man?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never met the man or woman so
bad that I couldn&rsquo;t work under the same roof with them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s doubtfully Christian to be so large-minded in my
opinion,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Do the other women up here think
the same?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alice Barefoot will sign; but her brother, Henry, will
not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Being an old sailor, no doubt he won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Mr. Pinhey.
He won Miss Barefoot&rsquo;s support, however, and then
skirmished in the neighbourhood of the vat house. Jordan
was not there, and after Mr. Life had appended his signature
and Harold Spry, Kellock&rsquo;s coucher, had declined to
do so, Nicholas approached Philander Knox.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know your exact opinions,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but I
should be glad if you can feel on this subject with most of
us serious people. You know the facts and feel it oughtn&rsquo;t
to go on, I expect&mdash;that is if you take life seriously, as
no doubt you do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The thing is to take other people&rsquo;s lives seriously and
your own pretty light,&rdquo; said Knox. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the best
way, because it keeps your sense of proportion about fair,
Pinhey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nicholas liked these problems, but was doubtful here.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean as a matter of morals?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;as a matter of business,&rdquo; replied Philander.
&ldquo;Because if you put yourself first always, your fellow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
creatures will be mighty quick to put you second, or third,
or out of the running altogether. Nobody bores people
worse than the man who is always thinking about himself.
But if you show a proper interest in others and their hopes
and fears and likes and dislikes, then the better sort will
gladly give as well as take. If you want anything for
nothing in this world, you won&rsquo;t get it; but the more you
give, the more you&rsquo;ll receive, in my experience. In the
matter of giving don&rsquo;t stint and don&rsquo;t squander; and don&rsquo;t
give where you&rsquo;ll get nothing back of course&mdash;that&rsquo;s
foolish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Pinhey shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Worldly wise, not heavenly wise,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;Be
so good as to read this document, Knox, and let me have
the pleasure of seeing you sign it. It&rsquo;s the elder people
I want to do so. In fact I&rsquo;m not showing it to the young
ones. Better such things should not enter their innocent
minds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Knox read Kellock&rsquo;s indictment and grinned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you know of sin, you old caterpillar?&rdquo; he
asked very rudely. &ldquo;Good powers, my man, d&rsquo;you see
what you&rsquo;re doing? You&rsquo;re shaving with a blunt razor
over another chap&rsquo;s wounds. Blow out reason&rsquo;s candle if
you like to walk without light; but don&rsquo;t from your darkness
presume to show other people their road. That&rsquo;s
damned impertinent and only makes the other sort cuss.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Pinhey shrank resentfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you make reason your guide,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;God help
you, Philander Knox. And&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tear it up&mdash;tear it up and save Trenchard the
trouble, Pinhey. Be guided by a man who&rsquo;s moved in a
larger world than yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A larger and a wickeder world, if you can talk like that
about sin,&rdquo; answered Nicholas, who had grown pinker than
his paper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not talking about sin. I&rsquo;d as soon talk about sin
to a bluebottle as you. You&rsquo;re one of the born good sort,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
you are, and the funny thing is that you&rsquo;ve worked in the
same business with Kellock all these years and years and
don&rsquo;t know he&rsquo;s the same order of creation as yourself.
Why, my dear man, he might be your son!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is too much and I won&rsquo;t stand it,&rdquo; answered Mr.
Pinhey. &ldquo;I ask you to recall that, Knox; or I won&rsquo;t know
you from this hour forward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be fussy. We&rsquo;re both well past our half century
and can air our opinions without getting cross. I
mean that Kellock is a serious-minded chap with a strong
character and steadfast opinions. He&rsquo;s just as anxious to
leave the world better than he found it as you are. And
he means to do so; and very likely, if he&rsquo;s not too deadly
in earnest and too narrow in his virtues, he may. You
must grant him his good character, Pinhey, and then ask
yourself whether a man with his past would have done this
without what seemed good and high reasons. I&rsquo;m not saying
he was right for a minute; but I&rsquo;m saying he weighed
it in all its bearings and from his mistaken and inexperienced
point of view made this big error.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And aren&rsquo;t we here to show him his error?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, we can&rsquo;t show it to him. You wouldn&rsquo;t convince
him if you talked for a month from your point of view.
Sit tight&mdash;that&rsquo;s all you&rsquo;ve got to do. I believe he&rsquo;s
made a big mistake and I believe he&rsquo;ll see it for himself
before he&rsquo;s six months older. But let his own nature work
and don&rsquo;t say more till you know more. What looks like
wickedness to one man&rsquo;s eye may seem goodness to another
man&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Pinhey had now grown calm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I won&rsquo;t waste more of your time,&rdquo; he answered.
&ldquo;You speak, I suppose, what you believe according to
reason; but I wouldn&rsquo;t say you were a very good advertisement
even for reason, Knox. I know your eyes will be
opened about that man sooner or later. I can only trust
that he&rsquo;s one by himself. I stand on the old paths and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
believe most of us here do the same. But if we&rsquo;re going to
set up Kellock and his ways as a model, then I don&rsquo;t see
myself what&rsquo;s to become of civilisation, or religion either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He departed, completed his rounds and confessed to disappointment
at the result. Still he had mustered a respectable
following and the document he left at Matthew
Trenchard&rsquo;s private house that evening was signed by
twenty-eight men and women in more or less responsible
positions.</p>

<p>To his everlasting surprise and indignation, Mr. Pinhey
never heard of the protest again. He might as well have
dropped it into the Dart, or posted it on the west wind.</p>

<p>A week passed and nothing happened. Nicholas had
met the master frequently and found him just as usual&mdash;cheery,
practical, busy. He fumed in secret. He told
Robert Life and old Mr. Amos Toft, who mixed the size,
that were it not for the fact that he only wanted a year to
qualify for his pension, he would resign.</p>

<p>Mrs. Trivett and Philander Knox discussed the matter
on an occasion when they met at close of work. It was
the day on which Lydia had to announce her decision with
respect to her admirer, and they both knew the time had
come.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll give the Corkscrew a miss and go round the
pond,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t talk climbing that Jacob&rsquo;s
ladder of a hill&mdash;at least I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her heart sank, for she had desired to make the painful
interview as brief as possible. But the event proved that
Lydia need not have feared, for Mr. Knox took her black
news in an unexpected spirit.</p>

<p>They spoke first, however, of Medora and Jordan
Kellock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never heard the like,&rdquo; said Lydia. &ldquo;It shows the
danger of doing such things and not counting the cost.
They was so wrapped up in their own affairs that they
never saw it takes three people to make a divorce, and now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
that injured man is opening their eyes. It&rsquo;s all as wrong
as wrong can be, yet where are you going to put the
blame?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to put the blame anywhere,&rdquo; answered
Mr. Knox. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot too much meddling, in my
opinion, and if they&rsquo;re only left alone, those three people
may work out their own salvation in their own way. I&rsquo;m
fed up with &rsquo;em: one would think the welfare of Dene hung
on their capers. To hear old Pinhey, you&rsquo;d say it depended
on our opinion about &rsquo;em whether we&rsquo;d ever get to
heaven ourselves. Where you can&rsquo;t help, don&rsquo;t worrit.
They&rsquo;re all right; but what about me? This is the appointed
time, Lydia, and I hope I may add that this is the
day of salvation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She jumped at the suggestion to lighten her refusal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I expect you may; and you&rsquo;ll look back at this evening
and feel you are better a free man. Yes, you must regard
yourself as free, please&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t do it&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t
take another. I&rsquo;m fond of you, if that is anything, and
I&rsquo;m proud you could have a fancy for me; for a reminder
that I&rsquo;m a woman, coming from such a man as you, naturally
makes me a bit above myself. But my life&rsquo;s run into
a mould, you see. It&rsquo;s found its channel, like a river does;
and it&rsquo;s made its bed. I say again I like you&mdash;I even
love you, if the word ain&rsquo;t nonsense at fifty; but I&rsquo;ve seen
my duty clear since we spoke about it. I couldn&rsquo;t fairly
leave my sister-in-law and brother. &rsquo;Twould be like taking
a screw out of a machine. The screw ain&rsquo;t much in itself
but a lot depends upon it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t marry me, you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t ain&rsquo;t the word. I&rsquo;d be very pleased to be your
wife if I was a free party, but in a sense I&rsquo;m not free.
You can&rsquo;t be in two places at once, like a flash of lightning,
and I can&rsquo;t keep house for you and look after Mary&rsquo;s family
and do my bit at Priory Farm. And it amounts to
this&mdash;my brother, when he heard what was afoot, made it
very clear that Priory Farm simply couldn&rsquo;t get on with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>out
me. That may seem a vain thing to you; but it&rsquo;s the
truth&mdash;absurd, I dare say; but they&rsquo;re built like that.
You, on the contrary, would get on without me well
enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Speak for yourself, but not for me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and not
for your brother, Tom, and his mate. Rabbits in a hutch
have got to be looked after, I grant, but you mustn&rsquo;t believe
everything you hear&mdash;even from Tom Dolbear.
Answer this: if you died to-morrow, what would happen
at Priory Farm? Why, my dear woman, in six weeks
they&rsquo;d have somebody in your place who looked after the
children all her time; and they&rsquo;d wonder why they never
thought of that before. We won&rsquo;t argue about it, however.
When you say &lsquo;duty,&rsquo; I&rsquo;m dumb, of course. But
tell me this before we drop the subject: would you marry
me if things were otherwise and your sense of duty didn&rsquo;t
come between?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Trivett was immensely relieved to find how quietly
he had taken his reverse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I would,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re one of the
best, and if it hadn&rsquo;t been that I&rsquo;d got to work out my life
same as I&rsquo;m doing, I&rsquo;d have been glad enough to come to
you. People at our time of day have got judgment, if
ever they&rsquo;re going to have it, and in my opinion we should
have made a well-matched pair enough. But such good
things are not for me. I&rsquo;ve been happily married once,
and can&rsquo;t expect it again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He continued to be quite restrained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I venture to think you&rsquo;re about as wrong as you can
be, Lydia, and your usual good sense has gone astray.
But I know duty&rsquo;s your guiding star, and I&rsquo;m happy to
think duty changes its shape from time to time, like most
other human contrivances.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll always try to do it, my dear man, however it
looks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will&mdash;that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m keeping so quiet now, instead
of breaking out and making a noise and lowering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
myself in your opinion. The beauty of a woman like you
is that you&rsquo;re steadfast&mdash;a slave, if not a martyr to
what you think right. That being so, I take your word
for the minute, and leave the rest to Providence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was puzzled, but very glad he could be so gentle
with her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve took it like the wise man you are,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;I might have known you would; but I was afraid you
wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t took it,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;There are some
things you don&rsquo;t take, and this is one of them. I&rsquo;ve a
great trust in the future, Lydia Trivett. The future,
though it plays many people false, have always treated
me in a very sportsmanlike and trustworthy manner so
far.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because you make your future just the same
as you make your paper, and leave nothing to chance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You never spoke a truer word,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
not going to brag before the event; but if ever I was properly
interested in a bit of my future, it&rsquo;s now; and if I can
get the pattern right, and stamp my will and purpose
upon it, I dare say you&rsquo;ll be a good bit surprised yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She became uneasy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you meddle with fate, however. That&rsquo;s not our
work,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what would you be inclined to call &lsquo;fate&rsquo;?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;in a manner of speaking, you
might call &lsquo;fate&rsquo; my dear brother, Tom, and his wife.
And I&rsquo;ll ask you not to touch them, Philander.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I promise that. That wouldn&rsquo;t be playing the game,&rdquo;
he admitted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be very sorry if they had anything
to do with my future, Lydia. You might as well try to
carve butter, or a turnip, into an enduring thing. I shall
treat your brother and his wife the same as I&rsquo;ve always
treated them. For the present, we&rsquo;ll just go on as we&rsquo;re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
going, please&mdash;good friends, and nothing more. I&rsquo;ve
a right to ask that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d take &lsquo;no&rsquo; for an answer, however.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing final about anything in this world except
death, my dear. While she&rsquo;s alive it&rsquo;s never too late
for a woman to change her mind. And if you did, it
would be very unfortunate if I was in such a position I
couldn&rsquo;t listen to you. You may ask me to marry you,
yet, Lydia&mdash;if Providence so wills it&mdash;though not leap
year, I believe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She laughed, and such was his amiability that he saw
her all the way home.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII<br />

<small>A TEST FOR JORDAN KELLOCK</small></h2></div>


<p>Philander Knox combined with his level temper and tolerant
philosophy an element of shrewdness which those with
whom his lot was now cast failed to appreciate. He was
no intriguer for choice, nor might he be called inquisitive;
but if the occasion demanded it and his own interests were
involved, Philander found himself quite prepared to employ
his latent gifts. He was cunning, with that peculiar sort
of craft that often belongs to expansive and genial natures;
he could, in fact, be exceedingly sly and even unscrupulous
within certain limits. Now the need for active
operations on his own behalf began to be obvious to Mr.
Knox. Finding that she cared for him, he had not the
smallest intention of losing Lydia. He felt her argument
against matrimony beneath serious consideration; but he
knew that to her the reasons for his rejection were grave
and sufficient, and he did not propose any counter-attack
on the front of his reverse.</p>

<p>He preferred a more circuitous response. He devoted
a great deal of time to the subject and then took an occasion
to see Medora. That he might do so, he would spend
his leisure by the river and smoke his pipe there out of
working hours. For some time he failed; but then came
a day when he saw her returning to &ldquo;The Waterman&rsquo;s
Arms&rdquo; from the village and greeted her.</p>

<p>Always glad to hear a kindly voice and aware that Knox
had become a friend of her family, Medora smiled upon the
vatman. He appeared gloomy, however, and their conversation
began by his confessing his private tribulations.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a heart,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and you are one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
brave sort that stand up to life and go through with a
thing like a good plucked one, even though you know
you&rsquo;ve made a mistake. Well, such show sympathy for
their neighbours, Medora, so I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll be sorry to
hear I&rsquo;ve had a great disappointment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other guessed what it was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother won&rsquo;t marry you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So she says; but on a very poor excuse in my opinion.
Such a sensible woman might have found a better reason
for turning me down. In fact she would&mdash;if there&rsquo;d been
a better reason; but the truth is there&rsquo;s no reason at all.
Therefore, though she thinks I&rsquo;m rejected, I don&rsquo;t regard
myself as in that position&mdash;not yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A love so venerable in her eyes did not interest Medora,
but she mildly wondered at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I can&rsquo;t think how you old people can run
after each other and drive each other miserable, when you
see what a beastly mess we young people make of love,&rdquo;
she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! You speak with a good deal of feeling. But we
old people&mdash;as you call us, rather thoughtlessly, Medora&mdash;we
old people don&rsquo;t take you children for a model.
We&rsquo;ve been through those stages, and what we understand
by love ain&rsquo;t what you understand by it. We&rsquo;ve forgotten
more than you know. I should have thought now that
Kellock&mdash;a man so much older than his years&mdash;might
have given you a glimpse of the beauty and steadfastness
of what we&rsquo;ll call middling to middle-aged love, Medora?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he has.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t his ideas appeal to you as a bit lofty and high
class&mdash;as compared with your first&rsquo;s notion of it for
instance?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked sharply at Mr. Knox, but did not answer.
He put the question moodily and appeared not interested
in an answer. Indeed he proceeded without waiting for
her to speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s two sorts of women, and you can divide them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
like this&mdash;the sort of women men go to when they want
to grumble about their wives, and the other sort. A man
knows by instinct whether he&rsquo;ll get a tender hearing, or
whether he won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know decent men did grumble about their
wives,&rdquo; said Medora.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you? Oh, yes, they do&mdash;even the best, sometimes.
If decent women can grumble about their husbands&mdash;you,
for example&mdash;why shouldn&rsquo;t decent men?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t got a husband at present,&rdquo; said Medora
sharply, &ldquo;so you needn&rsquo;t drag me in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The sensible way you look facts in the face is very
much to be admired,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of
girls, if they&rsquo;d done what you&rsquo;ve done, would bury their
heads in the sand, like the ostrich, and think it was all
right. But you don&rsquo;t let the truth escape you. I admire
you for that. In a way, it&rsquo;s true you haven&rsquo;t got a
husband at present, but on the other hand, you have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t pretend; I never will pretend,&rdquo; she answered,
pleased at his praise. &ldquo;I do look things in the face, as
you say, though nobody gives me credit for it, and I&rsquo;m
not going to call Mr. Kellock my husband till he is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t thinking so much about him as Mr. Dingle.
You&rsquo;re that fearless that you won&rsquo;t be afraid of the fact
that under the law he&rsquo;s your husband still, monstrous
though it may sound.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Medora nodded. She did not resent the statement,
but asked a curious question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How does he find himself?&rdquo; she inquired, and it was
Mr. Knox&rsquo;s turn to be surprised. But he showed no
astonishment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be plain, he&rsquo;s suffered a lot. I&rsquo;ve got the pleasure
of being his friend, because he knows I&rsquo;m a man who
keeps himself to himself, and doesn&rsquo;t push in where angels
fear to tread. He&rsquo;s given me his confidence, and I find
this has been a very cruel facer for Dingle&mdash;knocked him
out altogether. He&rsquo;ll get over it some day, as a brave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
man should. But he&rsquo;s got a warm heart, and he&rsquo;ll never
be quite the same again&mdash;naturally.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he&rsquo;s suffered, so have I,&rdquo; said Medora, &ldquo;and if
you&rsquo;re in his confidence, I may tell you that I want all my
pluck and a bit over sometimes. I knew more or less what
I was going to face; but I didn&rsquo;t know all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No woman ever does know all when she takes over a
man. It cuts both ways, however. Kellock didn&rsquo;t know
all when he ran away with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Know all! No, he don&rsquo;t know all. He don&rsquo;t know
half what I thought he knew, and what I&rsquo;d a right to think
he knew.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; said Mr. Knox. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t he, Medora?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m speaking in confidence, I hope?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That be sure of. I&rsquo;m old enough to be your father,
and shall faithfully respect your secrets, just as I respect
Mr. Kellock&rsquo;s, or Ned&rsquo;s, or anybody&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sometimes I think my life&rsquo;s going to turn into one
long Sunday now,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good sign, because it shows you&rsquo;re grasping
the stern truth; and it shows Jordan&rsquo;s breaking you in.
Once you&rsquo;re broken in, Medora, you and him will come
together in a real understanding spirit. No doubt the
first stages are rather painful to a handsome, clever bit
like you, with dashing ideas, and the memory of what life
was with Ned; but only give Kellock time, and the past
will grow dim, and you&rsquo;ll get used to the everlasting Sunday
idea. I greatly admire Kellock, because he never
changes. He&rsquo;ll be a bit monotonous at first compared
with the past, but he&rsquo;ll wear. You&rsquo;ll feel you&rsquo;re always
living in cold, bitter clear moonlight with Kellock; and I
dare say you&rsquo;ll miss the sunshine a bit for ten years
or so; but gradually you&rsquo;ll get chilled down to his way.
And once you&rsquo;ve settled to it, you&rsquo;ll hate the sunshine,
and come to be just a wise, owl-eyed sort, same
as him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Medora could not conceal a shiver.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve voted for moonlight and cold water against
sunshine and a glass of sparkling now and again&mdash;and,
no doubt, you&rsquo;re right, Medora.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She turned on him passionately.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t&mdash;don&rsquo;t, for God&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;What
d&rsquo;you think I&rsquo;m made of&mdash;ice?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not yet. You can&rsquo;t change your happy nature all in
a minute. It&rsquo;ll come over you gradual&mdash;like the salt
over Lot&rsquo;s wife. You naturally want to know what Ned&rsquo;s
going to do about it, and I&rsquo;ve been at him on that score&mdash;because
your mother&rsquo;s asked me to. She don&rsquo;t like the
present doubt and delay, and so on. It&rsquo;s uncomfortable,
and makes the unrighteous scoff.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he wants us to eat dirt&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, nothing like that. Ned&rsquo;s a gentleman, but
these things have shaken him. He&rsquo;ll make up his mind
presently, but he wants to act for the best&mdash;for your
sake. Not for Jordan&rsquo;s, but for yours. There&rsquo;s a lot
goes to such a thing as you&rsquo;ve done, and you want to be
a student of character before you decide about it. Ned
don&rsquo;t mean to let his feelings run away with him. He&rsquo;s
got to think of your future.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why has he sunk to damages against Mr. Kellock?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t believe anything you hear yet. I happen to
know that Ned has not settled upon that question. He&rsquo;s
very large-minded, as you&rsquo;ll remember.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That would be the last straw, I should think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t fairly quarrel with him, even if he do shake
a bit of cash out of your husband to be. I&rsquo;m sure I should
have. You may never know now all that you were to
Ned; but I know, and he knows. He&rsquo;s been wonderful,
in my opinion, and, with your great imagination, you
ought to see how wonderful. If he didn&rsquo;t kill Kellock,
why was it? Out of regard for himself? Not a chance!
Ned&rsquo;s fearless, as the male should be, and would hang for
Kellock to-morrow&mdash;especially seeing he&rsquo;s got no particular
interest in going on living himself, owing to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
shattering loss. No, Medora; he didn&rsquo;t spare your future
husband because he was frightened of letting daylight
into him; he spared him because he knew you loved him
better than anything on earth. You put that in your
pipe and smoke it, my dear. And take heart from it
also; for if Ned wouldn&rsquo;t sink to Kellock&rsquo;s life, you may
bet your pretty shoes he wouldn&rsquo;t touch his money. Now
I must get back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot more I&rsquo;d like to say, however. When
you do find a fellow creature that understands, which isn&rsquo;t
often, your soul craves to speak,&rdquo; said Medora.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Another time, perhaps. But mind this. Be fair.
You&rsquo;re so brave, I see, that you can afford to be fair to
all parties&mdash;friends and foes, so to call &rsquo;em. And you
know a fine character when you see it, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; concluded
Philander vaguely; then he sped away, leaving the
girl anxious both to hear and tell more. She did not comprehend
Mr. Knox in the least, but perceived he was
friendly. There was, moreover, a human ring in his voice
that heartened her, and she felt the contrast keenly when
she returned to the level tones and unimpassioned serenity
of Jordan Kellock.</p>

<p>But for once she did see Kellock taken out of himself,
and in a frame of mind enthusiastic and excited.</p>

<p>There came that evening a man to visit him from
Totnes. He was an earnest and serious-minded person,
well known to Jordan, and in his leisure he did secretarial
work for the local branch of the Independent Labour
Party. Upon that organisation, in the opinion of Kellock,
the hope and future prosperity of his class now hung.
By its activities alone salvation might presently be welcomed.
And now his friend, acting as mouth-piece of
the party, invited Kellock to deliver a lecture at Totnes,
on &ldquo;Our Aims and Hopes.&rdquo; It was understood that
county men of authority in the movement would be present,
and Kellock did not need his fellow politician to point
out that herein their side designed the young vatman an
opportunity to show what he was good for.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll jump at it, of course, and do your very best.
It may be worth a lot to you if you get &rsquo;em. Lawson and
Jenkins will be there from Plymouth, and very likely
Sawdye, from Newton. I&rsquo;ll beat up the Totnes crowd.
Give &rsquo;em an hour of your hottest stuff, and keep the shop-stewards
to the front. We want to get a move on the
unions all round. They&rsquo;re growing a bit mouldy in their
ideas; but Labour can&rsquo;t stand still for them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The trades unions were made for Labour, not Labour
for trades unions,&rdquo; declared Kellock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right; you rub that into them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young man stayed to supper, and he and Kellock
soared to heights that Medora had not yet imagined.
Jordan was full of life, and displayed a vivacity that he
had never displayed in conversation on his private affairs.
It was clear that nothing personal would ever light such
fires. They were reserved for the cause and the cause
alone.</p>

<p>When the man from Totnes had departed, Kellock addressed
Medora.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may say that this is the biggest thing that has
ever happened to me,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect it yet,
and I must confess I&rsquo;m a good bit gratified.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So it seems,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; because the people who are running our show in
Devon are very jealous, naturally, that we shall give a
good account of ourselves. There&rsquo;s a feeling in some
quarters that nothing much in the way of fighting intellect
comes from the West Country. Londoners and Northerners
think it&rsquo;s a sort of Turkish bath all the time down
here&mdash;a place for holidays and Devonshire cream and
playing about. So if I&rsquo;m to be reported, as I shall be,
that means a pretty good advertisement and a pretty high
compliment. It&rsquo;s come sooner than I expected, and I must
rise to it, Medora.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t frightened to get up and talk to a crowd of
men?&rdquo;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>&ldquo;Not if I know I&rsquo;m saying the right thing. I&rsquo;d be
frightened to do it if I wasn&rsquo;t dead sure I was right, and
that my ideas&mdash;our ideas&mdash;will rule the world before
I&rsquo;m an old man; but they will. I must prepare my speech
with my heart and soul. Everything must give way
to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Including me, I suppose?&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re in what they call another category, Medora.
You are part of my own life&mdash;personal to me as I&rsquo;m
personal to you and, of course, our private affairs mean
a lot to us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you think that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But this belongs to the world of ideas&mdash;to our souls
and our highest ambitions&mdash;what we&rsquo;re born for, so to
speak. I include you in it, Medora.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t then,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;because though it may
appear a small thing to you, my highest ambition at present
is to know when I shall be a married woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk in that tone of voice,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I feel
all that, too, and you know I do, and I&rsquo;m not going to sit
down under it much longer; but that&rsquo;s in another category,
as I tell you. It won&rsquo;t bring it any nearer talking. I&rsquo;ll
see, or write, to Mr. Dingle before much longer, if he
doesn&rsquo;t set to work; but in the meantime this affair will
call for all my thought and attention out of business
hours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it would be a convenience to you if I went
and lived somewhere else?&rdquo;</p>

<p>His forehead wrinkled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When you say things like that, I never can be sure if
you mean them for satire, or not,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;If
you&rsquo;re meaning it for satire, you&rsquo;re wrong, Medora, and
I blame you; but if you really mean it, out of consideration
to my time, then I can assure you there&rsquo;s no need
for you to go. In fact, you&rsquo;ll type the lecture, I hope.
It&rsquo;s going to be quite as much to you as to me, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can it be? You&rsquo;re so thick-skinned. What&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
the good of lectures to a person who&rsquo;s living my life?
You don&rsquo;t care. You&rsquo;ve got your work and your ambitions,
and you&rsquo;ll have the honour and glory, if there is
any. But where do I come in? Who am I? What am
I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My future wife, I should think. You can&rsquo;t accuse me
of anything wrong in that category, Medora.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not accusing you; I&rsquo;m past all that. I&rsquo;ll try to
copy you. I&rsquo;ll be patient. If you say you&rsquo;ll see Mr.
Dingle, or write to him&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall see him. He&rsquo;s coming back, so I hear, to Ashprington.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he returned to his lecture, and, with the ardour
of youth, did not sleep that night until he had roughed out
a general plan and placed the heads of his composition
clearly before him.</p>

<p>Long after Medora had gone to bed and the little inn
was asleep, Jordan scribbled on, and surprised himself at
the compass of his thoughts. He was amazed to hear the
clock strike two, and put away his books and papers at
once.</p>

<p>He could recollect no previous occasion in his life on
which he had been awake at two o&rsquo;clock in the morning.
He fell asleep longing to read what he had written to Medora,
for he felt dimly sometimes that he was more outside
her life and its interests than he should be; and since
he could never rejoice her on any material base of trivial
pleasures, he must make good his claim by force of intellect
and a future far above that which the average
working man could promise.</p>

<p>But he also intended to bend the bow in reason, let life
have its say, and their home its domestic happiness. He
believed that, when they were married, they would soon
become everything in the world to one another.</p>

<p>He went to sleep in a very happy, exalted frame of
mind, and felt that life had taken an unexpected stride
in the right direction.</p>

<small>THE WISDOM OF PHILANDER</small></h2></div>


<p>When Ned Dingle returned home, his future still unsettled,
he had the privilege of an early visit from Mr. Knox.</p>

<p>They sat in Ned&rsquo;s small kitchen garden, and Philander
advised him to plant his peas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Damn the peas,&rdquo; said Ned. &ldquo;Listen to me. I was
as good as booked at Ivybridge when I got your letter
telling me to hang on. What&rsquo;s the good all the same?
I don&rsquo;t know why for I should have listened to you, but
I know you&rsquo;ve got sense, and so I left it for the minute.
I can&rsquo;t go back to Trenchard, if that&rsquo;s what you meant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I meant a lot of things,&rdquo; answered the elder. &ldquo;I
think so deuced highly of you, Dingle, that you&rsquo;ve got
on my mind more than any man ever did before, and I&rsquo;m
very wishful, for more reasons than one, to do you a
turn. For the minute, however, it rests with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it does. I&rsquo;m fed up with hearing that. Well,
I&rsquo;m going on with it. I&rsquo;m going to get the heaviest damages
the law will give me out of that swine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good&mdash;so far as it goes. And if things weren&rsquo;t exactly
as they are, I should say ditto. But it&rsquo;s a very
peculiar case, quite contrary to my experience, and it calls
for a pinch of patience yet. Nobody has any right to
dictate to you, because you&rsquo;re a man of good judgment,
and I reckon you&rsquo;ve done dead right so far, and kept your
nerve better than I should, or many older men with less
intellects; but don&rsquo;t you spoil the ship for a hap&rsquo;p&rsquo;oth of
tar, Ned. It&rsquo;s paid you so mighty well to wait and hang
off, that it may pay you better still to go on waiting.&rdquo;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>&ldquo;It only hurts her&mdash;it don&rsquo;t hurt him. They&rsquo;ll say
I&rsquo;m bullying a woman, next, and putting him in the right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only the ignorant would talk like that. But I know
your mother-in-law, and I also know Medora. The females
of that family want very careful handling, Ned;
and in confidence, I may tell you that Mrs. Trivett is being
very carefully handled&mdash;by me. But Medora is not being
carefully handled&mdash;quite the contrary. Kellock
don&rsquo;t understand the female mind&mdash;how could he with
a face like his?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that to me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the question. Not that I want an answer.
I&rsquo;m only wishful to put certain facts before you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did she ever think, in her silliest moments, that
man would have any lasting use for her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He got on her blind side, I suppose; for even a remarkable
woman, like Medora, has her blind side. Who
hasn&rsquo;t? But the interesting thing for you&mdash;and only
for you&mdash;to consider, is that Medora sees straight
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s her mother says that. I don&rsquo;t believe it.
She&rsquo;s a lot too conceited to admit that she made an infernal
fool of herself. She&rsquo;d rather go miserable to her
grave than give herself away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You naturally think so, having no idea what a power
there is in the clash of opposite characters. Medora is
proud, and has a right to be, because she is beautiful and
very fine stuff, given the right nature to mould her. And
she thought&mdash;mistaken girl&mdash;because you were easy and
good tempered, and liked to see her happy, that you
weren&rsquo;t strong enough. That&rsquo;s why, in a moment of
youthful folly, she went over to Kellock, before she knew
anything whatever about the man&rsquo;s true character. Now,
of course, she finds her mistake. And don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m
getting this from Mrs. Trivett. One wouldn&rsquo;t take her
opinion, being the girl&rsquo;s mother. No, I had it from Medora
herself. I happened by chance to meet her, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
gave her &lsquo;good day,&rsquo; for I don&rsquo;t make other people&rsquo;s
quarrels mine; and we had a bit of a yarn; and I won&rsquo;t
disguise from you, Ned, that I saw the punishment was
fitting the crime all right. She&rsquo;s got a good brain, and
every day that passes over her head is enlarging that
brain. She&rsquo;ll be a valuable wife for somebody some day;
but not for Kellock. She sees Kellock now in the cold
light of truth. She don&rsquo;t run him down, or anything
rude like that; but she just talks about him and his
character like a sister might. My word, she&rsquo;s clever!
She said that living with Kellock would be like living in
moonlight. Did you ever hear a sharper thought? That
just describes it. And where&rsquo;s the woman that wants to
live in moonlight? You see, she knows. She didn&rsquo;t come
to Kellock without experience of the other thing. After
you, of course, a cold creature like him is like milk after
treble X. I feel it myself. Not a word against Kellock,
mind you&mdash;he was utterly misled, and came a cropper,
too; but he&rsquo;s got the virtues of his failings, and being ice,
he behaved as such, and has always treated her just the
same as he&rsquo;d have treated his maiden aunt&mdash;except he&rsquo;d
have kissed his aunt, but not Medora. So I put it before
you, and leave you to turn over the peculiar circumstances,
Ned. As I say, the punishment is going on
very steady, and your tactics couldn&rsquo;t be beat in my judgment.
They deserve to suffer; and she does; and if Kellock
weren&rsquo;t so darned busy about what matters to him
more, he&rsquo;d be suffering too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He will, when I knock all his savings out of him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, he won&rsquo;t&mdash;that would only hit her. He&rsquo;s got
no use for money. He don&rsquo;t want more than the clothes
he stands up in. But it ain&rsquo;t my business to bother you
about what you&rsquo;re very well equal to manage yourself.
I really came for quite a different reason, and that&rsquo;s the
Mill. Bulstrode is going. He can&rsquo;t stick Ernest Trood,
and Trood can&rsquo;t stick him. It happened yesterday, and
in a month from now we must have a new beaterman.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
You might not have heard that. Not that you&rsquo;ll come
back, of course; but in your wanderings you may have
heard of somebody?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t. I must fix myself up now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a thousand pities things are as they are, but if
I was you, I&rsquo;d mark time a little longer, if you can afford
to do so. And don&rsquo;t forget the peas. They ought to
be in. You may not be here to eat them; but, on the other
hand, you may.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As to that, how about you?&rdquo; asked Dingle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There again, I&rsquo;m not in a position to close for the
house yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If she&rsquo;s said &lsquo;no,&rsquo; she means &lsquo;no,&rsquo; Knox. Mrs. Trivett
don&rsquo;t change.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;More don&rsquo;t the weather-cock, Ned; but the wind does.
It all comes back to patience, and, thank God, you and
me are both patient and far-sighted men&mdash;else we
shouldn&rsquo;t stand so firm on our feet as we do. Now I&rsquo;ll
bid you good-night. And have a talk with Mr. Trenchard
one day. There&rsquo;s wells of good sense in that man.
The more I see of him, the more I find in him. He&rsquo;s got
more brains in his little finger than we can boast of in
our whole heads. And a warm heart also.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Philander withdrew, and went very thoughtfully homeward.
He felt sure that Dingle would consider his remarks,
and hesitated once or twice about returning and
adding another touch; but he decided that nothing more
need be said for the present.</p>

<p>On the following day, to her surprise, he sought Mrs.
Trivett in the dinner hour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fear nothing,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and go on with your food.
I haven&rsquo;t come to spoil it; but you know very well your
good&rsquo;s mine, and it happens that I&rsquo;ve got an idea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re very kind,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel,
however, I&rsquo;ve any right to your ideas&mdash;not now. But
you rise above a little thing like that, and you&rsquo;ll probably
live to know I was right.&rdquo;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>&ldquo;It was the exception that proves the rule,&rdquo; declared
Mr. Knox. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re nearly always right, though in refusing
me you were wrong. But let that pass. I&rsquo;m considering
your point of view. What&rsquo;s in my mind now
is not you, but your daughter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to see her this evening. She&rsquo;s wrote me a
letter asking me for God&rsquo;s sake to come and have a cup
of tea. There&rsquo;s no doubt this waiting is getting on her
nerves. It&rsquo;s very improper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be surprised at what I&rsquo;m going to say; but
yesterday I had a remarkable conversation with your son-in-law.
There&rsquo;s a lot more in that man than he gets credit
for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s behaved very well, I grant you&mdash;amazing well;
but it&rsquo;s more than time he went on with it. He didn&rsquo;t
ought to treat them like a cat treats a mouse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not that sort. He looks far beyond anything
like that. He looks all round the subject in a way that
surprised me. Have no fear he won&rsquo;t do right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be right in my opinion to take damages out
of Kellock&mdash;that&rsquo;s revenge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s only human. But what I&rsquo;m coming to is
this. Ned has got a very righteous down on Kellock, and
feels no need to show mercy there, for Kellock showed him
none; but he don&rsquo;t feel the same to Medora.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since when?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Trivett. &ldquo;He felt the same
to her all right last time I saw him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But not now. His mind worked at Ivybridge, and he
turned over the situation. And, in a word, if Kellock is
going to save his skin and be let off, he&rsquo;ll have to thank
Medora for it. I&rsquo;m saying a delicate thing, of course,
and to anybody less wise than you, I wouldn&rsquo;t say it, because
I should be laughed at; but I do believe, if Medora
could see Dingle while there&rsquo;s yet time, and afore he&rsquo;s
loosed his lawyer, Kellock might escape damages. What
do you think? Should you say Medora and Ned might
speak?&rdquo;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>&ldquo;Medora would speak to him if she thought she could
serve Jordan Kellock, I dare say; but whether he&rsquo;d listen
I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In my opinion, if Medora would speak, he&rsquo;d listen.
It ought, however, to be done by stealth. Neither one
nor the other must know they&rsquo;re going to meet. Then
it would surprise them both, and Medora might get round
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no danger in it for Medora, you reckon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;None; I&rsquo;ve heard him on the subject. He may dress
her down and tell her a bit of the truth about her conduct,
and he may use some very harsh words to her; but
more he would not do, and if she took it in a humble
spirit, I dare say she&rsquo;d come out top and get him to drop
the damages when he divorces her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Trivett considered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see any harm could come of it, even if no good
did,&rdquo; she replied, after a pause. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll sound Medora.
She&rsquo;d be glad to do Kellock a turn, naturally.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope she still feels confident about Kellock. I can&rsquo;t
say she spoke with great warmth about the man last time
I met her; but that was a passing cloud, I expect. He&rsquo;s
going to give a lecture, and set the world right, at Totnes,
presently, he tells me. I&rsquo;ve promised to be there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When some hours later, Mrs. Trivett started to take
tea with her daughter, Medora met her by the river, and
revealed a restless and melancholy mood.</p>

<p>Lydia sighed, and walked beside her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s the best news with you, my dear?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no best,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re just waiting,
and I&rsquo;m ageing and growing into a fright before my
time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The typewriter&rsquo;s come, Jordan tells me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; it&rsquo;s come. I&rsquo;m writing out his speech. But the
minute I&rsquo;ve made a clean sheet, he alters it all and messes
it about. It&rsquo;s getting on his nerves, I believe, and I&rsquo;ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
swear it&rsquo;s getting on mine. I don&rsquo;t hear anything else,
morning, noon, and night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s distracting his mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; he can&rsquo;t think of more than one thing at a
time, Jordan can&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m just a machine now, like the
typewriter. I told him yesterday I didn&rsquo;t hold with
some of his opinions about labour, and he couldn&rsquo;t have
been more surprised if the typewriter had spoken to
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t argue about his views if I was you, Medora.
They&rsquo;re his life, in a manner of speaking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall argue about &rsquo;em if I choose. He&rsquo;d think no
better of me if I humbly said ditto to all he says. He goes
a lot too far, and he&rsquo;d take the shirts off the backs of
the rich, if he could. He reads it over and over, and I
very near stamp sometimes. Nothing will ever make me a
socialist now. I dare say I might have been if he&rsquo;d gone
about it different; but now now. And, anyway, I&rsquo;m not
going to be the echo to Jordan, just because he takes it for
granted I must be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s found a house, he tells me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has, but he wants to beat down the rent a bit.
He&rsquo;s afraid of his life that Dingle&rsquo;s going to have his savings
out of him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s as may be. I dare say he&rsquo;ll do no such thing.
It wouldn&rsquo;t be like Ned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Life&rsquo;s properly dreadful for me&mdash;that&rsquo;s all I know
about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dare say it is. You&rsquo;ve got to wait the will of other
people now, Medora; and it&rsquo;s a thing you never much liked
doing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not friendless&mdash;I&rsquo;m not friendless,&rdquo; she said
fiercely. &ldquo;To hear Jordan talk, you&rsquo;d think he&rsquo;s the
only thing that stands between me and the streets; and I
won&rsquo;t have it. People don&rsquo;t hate me&mdash;not all of them.
But you&rsquo;d imagine that, without Jordan, there&rsquo;d be no
place on earth for me now.&rdquo;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>&ldquo;I thought he was very gentle and proper in his treatment,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Trivett.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t explain. I only mean that he seems to think
that if it wasn&rsquo;t for his watchful care, and coming between
me and every wind that blows, I&rsquo;d be torn to pieces
by my fellow creatures. And what about him? If I
did wrong, what about him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather late in the day to talk like that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want him to see all the same that I&rsquo;m not a lone,
friendless, outcast creature, without anyone to care for
me. I don&rsquo;t like to be championed by him, as if I was a
fallen woman, and he was a saint. I won&rsquo;t have it, I tell
you. I&rsquo;m not a fallen woman any more than he&rsquo;s a fallen
man, and I want him to know the world isn&rsquo;t against me
any more than it&rsquo;s against him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lydia was surprised.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This all seems silly nonsense to me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If
you had anything to do, you&rsquo;d not waste time worrying
over things like that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t understand, mother. It&rsquo;s like being patronised
in a sort of way, and Jordan shan&rsquo;t patronise me.
At any rate, I want to come to Priory Farm for a bit&mdash;just
to show him I&rsquo;m not dependent on him, and have got
a few good relations in the world. Surely, I might do
that&mdash;just for a week or two&mdash;till he has got this blessed
lecture off his mind? I know all he is, and I love the
ground he walks on; but, along of one thing and another,
he&rsquo;s not quite taking me in the right spirit for the moment,
and I do think it would be a very wise thing if I
was to come to you for a week or so. Please let me.
They won&rsquo;t mind there. They&rsquo;d do anything you wished.
It would show Jordan in a ladylike way, without any unpleasantness,
that I&rsquo;m somebody still.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely to God, you don&rsquo;t want to leave him?&rdquo; asked
Lydia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leave him? No&mdash;I&rsquo;ve had enough of leaving people.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
He&rsquo;s everything to me, and I&rsquo;d lay down my life for him,
I&rsquo;m sure; but just for the minute, even with him, I feel
I&rsquo;ve got to fight for myself a bit. It wouldn&rsquo;t be a bad
thing for him to see what his life is without me. If I go,
he&rsquo;ll miss me at every turn, and he&rsquo;ll think a bit more of
me when I come back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you say he thinks too much of you as it is, and
fusses more than he need.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He thinks too much and too little. I can&rsquo;t explain&mdash;there&rsquo;s
no words to it. But let it go. I ask to come and
spend a bit of time at Priory Farm. Surely you&rsquo;ll let
me do that? I&rsquo;m getting so thin and low that I believe
I&rsquo;ll die if I&rsquo;ve got to worry much longer. A week or two
with you will set me up, and make me braver. My nerves
are all on edge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Medora was tearful and agitated. Probably her mother
understood her better than she pretended. Kellock was
not unctuous, but utterly humourless, and, in the matter
of Medora, he did sometimes unconsciously take a line
that suggested the stained-glass attitude. It was as
much her fault as his, for, at an earlier stage in their
companionship, she had never tired of telling him how she
appreciated his sacrifices, his noble patience, and chivalric
support of herself. A man without sense of proportion
could not fail to be influenced by such assurances from
the woman he loved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall come certainly,&rdquo; said Lydia, &ldquo;and there&rsquo;s
no need to take on and let things fret you to fiddlestrings.
It&rsquo;ll happen right presently. It may be a good thing for
you to stop at Cornworthy for a while.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She remembered Philander&rsquo;s suggestion that Medora
might, with advantage, see Ned. It would be possible to
arrange such a meeting at Cornworthy perhaps; and if
Medora prevailed with Mr. Dingle to renounce his threat
of claiming damages, that must be to the good.</p>

<p>She promised her daughter that she should come, drank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
tea with her, and left her happier than she had been for
a long time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not so much for myself as for Jordan,&rdquo; declared
Medora. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be good for him and open his eyes a bit
to hear I&rsquo;m going to Uncle and Aunt Dolbear on a visit.
They forgave him and all that; but I don&rsquo;t think he
knows they are friendly enough to have me at Priory
Farm, and it will be right that he should know it. There&rsquo;s
other reasons, too. If I can escape from going to his
lecture, it will be a blessing. He&rsquo;ll make a rare fuss;
but if I once get to Priory Farm, I can fall ill, or something
to avoid it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lydia went home in a melancholy mood after this interview,
and her daughter&rsquo;s unrest descended upon her.</p>

<p>She could not understand the relations between Kellock
and Medora. They appeared to be extraordinary, as far
as Medora was concerned, and the more Mrs. Trivett considered
the various reports, the less able was she to put a
cheerful interpretation upon them.</p>

<small>NED AND MEDORA</small></h2></div>


<p>When Lydia asked that Medora might come to stop at
the farm, Mary and Tom spoke simultaneously, for each
hastened to be the first to accord permission.</p>

<p>They had suffered acute anxieties concerning Mrs. Trivett&rsquo;s
possible departure, and when she told them that she
had determined to remain, nothing was good enough for
her.</p>

<p>In their joy and relief they grovelled before Lydia,
heaped compliments upon her, and declared that never
for a moment had they entertained the least doubt concerning
her decision, even while, with every thankful word
and exultant exclamation, they revealed the depth of their
past anxiety and height of their vanished fear. She saw
through it, and only left them uneasy in one particular.</p>

<p>Mr. Knox, so Lydia explained, had taken his disappointment
in a spirit of great self-restraint, and behaved
with such magnanimity and understanding that when he
desired the continued friendship of Mrs. Trivett, she could
not deny it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For that matter, I&rsquo;m proud to have him for a friend,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s full of sense, and as he&rsquo;s prepared to
offer friendship to me and mine, I&rsquo;m prepared to accept it,
and you mustn&rsquo;t mind if he comes to tea of a Sunday sometimes,
and such like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t allude to the past, or anything like that,
I hope?&rdquo; asked Mr. Dolbear doubtfully. &ldquo;Because, in
his rage at his loss, he might be tempted to give me
and my wife the blame; and if he did that, I should round
on him, and there&rsquo;d be a scene.&rdquo;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>&ldquo;Fear nothing of the sort,&rdquo; replied his sister. &ldquo;You
may take it from me it won&rsquo;t happen. In fact, I went
into it, and I&rsquo;ve got his undertaking never to say one
word to you or Polly on the subject. And he&rsquo;s a man
you may say whose word is his bond.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then let him come,&rdquo; decided Tom. &ldquo;If he&rsquo;s got that
bee out of his bonnet, I don&rsquo;t want to quarrel with him.
I never doubted his sense, save in that fatal matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got a nice hand with the children, too,&rdquo; said
Mary. &ldquo;I will say that for him; and where a child of
mine takes, you may generally trust the party.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the matter of Medora, there was no difficulty; nor
did Jordan make any. Medora, in fact, felt a shadow
of disappointment that he agreed so willingly. It was
only a lesser grievance than refusal had been.</p>

<p>She made a great business of her petition, but he made
no business whatever of granting it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got the lecture through now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and
there won&rsquo;t be no need for another copy yet, if at all,
and you&rsquo;ve heard me deliver it so often that I&rsquo;ll be glad
for you to go and get a rest. Then you&rsquo;ll come back all
the fresher to it, and to the actual night, when I give it
at Totnes a fortnight hence. Go, by all means, and I&rsquo;ll
come over to tea on Sunday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Medora, who would have wearied Heaven with her
griefs, had he questioned the plan, now flushed that he
approved it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One would think you was glad to get rid of me,&rdquo; she
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;d think so?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good idea, and
will give you a bit of a rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you, too, perhaps?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want a rest; but life&rsquo;s been getting on your
nerves above a bit lately, and the calm of the farm and
the fun of the children, and being with your mother, and
so on&mdash;it&rsquo;s to the good, Medora. And soon, I hope,
we&rsquo;ll know something definite, so that this suspense can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
end. It&rsquo;s bad for you, and I should think the man was
enough of a man to know he&rsquo;s doing a mean and cowardly
thing to hang it up like this any longer. So you go, and
rest quietly; and as I told you, if he doesn&rsquo;t proceed soon,
I shall approach him again with an ultimatum.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s him that will have the ultimatum, I should think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Medora went to Priory Farm, and since she knew
very well how to please her aunt, made a point of doing so.
Indeed, Mrs. Dolbear considered she was much improved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never thought she would rise to children,&rdquo; said
Mary to her sister-in-law, &ldquo;but of late, I may say, there&rsquo;s
hope in that direction. She&rsquo;s more patient and quicker
to see danger threatening a child. There was a time I
wouldn&rsquo;t have trusted her too far with Milly or Bobby,
let alone Jenny; but all that&rsquo;s altered. She may even be
a good mother herself yet in fulness of time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Indeed, Medora shone at the farm, and displayed consideration
for other people that might hardly have been
predicted even by the sanguine. Mary Dolbear was one
who gave everybody ample opportunities to be unselfish,
and Medora not only perceived these opportunities, but
took them. She had changed, and none realised how much
better than Lydia. But still the wisdom of any meeting
between her daughter and Ned seemed doubtful. She hesitated
to bring it about, and was still hesitating when
chance accomplished it.</p>

<p>Medora had been at Cornworthy for ten days and once
Jordan came to tea during that time. He was full of
some alterations in his lecture, but brought no news of interest
to his future wife.</p>

<p>Then she went for a walk by the ponds above the Mill,
where emerald reflections of alder and willow and birch
were washed over the silver surface of the little mere, and
a great wealth of green leapt again above the mats and
tussocks of the sedge and rush. Golden kingcups flashed
along the shallows, and bluebells wove their light into the
banks above the water.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>Medora was actually engaged in the innocent business
of picking flowers when she came plump upon Ned. They
met at a narrow beach running into the lake under a limestone
crag; and he, too, was there on pleasure, for he
was fishing. Strangely enough, each was possessed with
the same idea, and seemed to think it necessary to explain
to the other the situation in which they stood revealed.</p>

<p>Ned scowled and started; Medora blushed. While he
stared, she spoke, without any preliminaries and as though
no terrific events separated them. It seemed as if the
trivial accident of being there picking flowers demanded
first consideration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m here for pleasure,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m only killing time. We&rsquo;ve got to wait your will, and
I&rsquo;ve got to go on living as best as I can. We&rsquo;re at your
mercy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He, too, fastened on the moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As to that, same here. It&rsquo;s true I&rsquo;m fishing, but only
to kill time, same as you. I&rsquo;m not in any mood for pleasure,
I can tell you, woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dare say not,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;People often fall
back on little things when big things are hanging over
them. I know how you feel, because I feel the same.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know how I feel,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;And
don&rsquo;t you dare to say you do, please. What do you know
about feeling? You&rsquo;re the senseless rubbish that can hurt
others, but you&rsquo;re not built to suffer yourself more than a
stinging nettle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She felt no pang of anger at his rough challenge. After
Kellock&rsquo;s steadfast voice, the ferocious accents of Ned
were rather agreeable than not. His tone for once was
deep, as an angry bull. She liked it, and thought he
looked exceedingly well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As long as he don&rsquo;t throw me in the water, I&rsquo;ll speak
to him,&rdquo; thought Medora.</p>

<p>Ned expected a stinging reply to his preliminary chal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>lenge,
but she did not answer it. Instead, she spoke of an
utter triviality.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;you think&rsquo;s in my mind&mdash;to show how little
things get hold on you? The first thing that come in it
when I saw you so close was pleasure, because I was wearing
a pink sunbonnet&mdash;that being your favourite colour
for me. But Mr. Kellock don&rsquo;t know what I wear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He started with genuine astonishment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What in thunder be women made of? You can babble
like that and pick flowers, and be a hen devil all the
time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I am a hen devil, then I&rsquo;m in the proper place for
devils, and that&rsquo;s hell,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;D&rsquo;you think a woman
can&rsquo;t pick flowers and wear pink and yet be broken to
pieces heart and soul?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you ought to be. You was always playing at being
a martyr, and now you damned well can be one. And
I hope you are. The trouble with you was that I spoiled
you and fooled you to the top of your bent, and let you
bully-rag me, and never turned round and gave you a bit
of the naked truth yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You were a great deal too
fond of me for my good, Ned, and if you hadn&rsquo;t loved me
so well, I dare say you&rsquo;d have been a better husband.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t have been a better husband,&rdquo; he answered,
&ldquo;and if you&rsquo;d been made of decent stuff, you&rsquo;d have
known it. Not that I didn&rsquo;t see the ugly truth about you&mdash;I
did; but I hoped and hoped that with time you&rsquo;d get
more sense, and so I held my tongue and held on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How I wish you&rsquo;d told me my faults, Ned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You oughtn&rsquo;t to want telling. If you&rsquo;d got any conscience,
which you never had, you&rsquo;d have seen your faults
and suffered from &rsquo;em, as you ought. For one thing, you
were greedy as the grave, and that envious that you didn&rsquo;t
like anybody else to have anything you lacked. If you
saw a worm on the ground, you wished you was a bird.
&rsquo;Twas always so. Everybody else was better off than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
you, and had got nicer cats and gardens and husbands
and everything. A filthy jealousy it was that made you
miserable, when you ought to have been happy, and
tempted you off to try your luck with this thing, that&rsquo;s
only a machine, not a man. Some chaps would have took
you two and smashed your heads together like egg-shells,
as you deserved; but I&rsquo;m above anything like that. You
thought I was a fool; but I wasn&rsquo;t such a fool as to do
that. You wrecked me, but I wasn&rsquo;t going to wreck you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wrecked myself, more likely,&rdquo; said Medora.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know nothing about that. Whatever you get
won&rsquo;t be half what you deserve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ned appeared to have changed for the better in Medora&rsquo;s
eyes. The harsher were his words, the better she
liked them. Here was real martyrdom. The emotion of
this suffering became a luxury. She wept, but was not in
the least unhappy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve ruined two very fine men&mdash;that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve
done,&rdquo; said Medora. She flung down her kingcups and
bluebells, and sat on a stone and covered her face with
her pocket-handkerchief.</p>

<p>He looked at her fiercely, and rated her from a savage
heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Crocodile tears! You never even cried like a decent
woman, from your heart, because you haven&rsquo;t got a heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Your heart can&rsquo;t break
if you haven&rsquo;t got one, and mine&rsquo;s broken all right now.
With all my dreadful faults, I&rsquo;m human&mdash;only too much
so. I know what I&rsquo;ve done, and what I&rsquo;ve lost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what you&rsquo;ve won, too&mdash;a lunatic, that will very
likely end on the gallows as a traitor to the country, or
some such thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, he won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s too dull for that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can call him dull, can you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve no right to make me talk about him,&rdquo; answered
she; &ldquo;all the same, honesty&rsquo;s no crime, and I say he&rsquo;s a
dull man, because anybody with only one idea is dull.&rdquo;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>&ldquo;Yes, no doubt; if you&rsquo;re not his one idea yourself,
you find him dull. And when you were my only idea,
you still wanted more&mdash;always wanted more&mdash;more than
you had of everything but trouble; and now you&rsquo;ve brewed
that for yourself. And what d&rsquo;you mean, when you say
you&rsquo;ve ruined his life as well as mine?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Medora enjoyed the lash of his scornful voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll kill me if you speak so harsh,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I
meant&mdash;I meant&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know what I meant. Only it&rsquo;s
clear to me that I shan&rsquo;t make him the wife he thinks I
shall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true for once. You&rsquo;re no wife for any man.
And as for him, he don&rsquo;t want a flesh and blood woman
for his partner, and if you hadn&rsquo;t thrown yourself at his
head, like a street-walker, he&rsquo;d never have taken you.
The shamelessness&mdash;the plotting&mdash;the lies. When you
grasp hold of what you&rsquo;ve done, you ought to want to
drown yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I may do it sooner than you think for,&rdquo; she answered.
&ldquo;Rub it in&mdash;I deserve it; but don&rsquo;t fancy I&rsquo;m not being
paid worse coin than any word of yours. I&rsquo;m only a
woman&mdash;not much more than a girl, you may say; and
I&rsquo;ve done you bitter wrong, but there&rsquo;s always two sides
to everything, and justice will be done to me&mdash;in fact,
it&rsquo;s begun. You say Kellock never wanted a flesh and
blood woman, and that&rsquo;s true&mdash;truer than you know.
So you can see what my future&rsquo;s going to be. Once you&rsquo;re
free, you can find a better and prettier and wiser creature
than me to-morrow; but I&rsquo;m done for to the end of my
life. He&rsquo;s much too good for me&mdash;I know that&mdash;so
were you&mdash;far too good; but there it is. I&rsquo;m done for&mdash;down
and out, as you would say. He&rsquo;ll go and live in a
town presently. Think of me in a town!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sorry for yourself always&mdash;and never for nobody
else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for everybody that ever I was born. I
don&rsquo;t want to bring any more trouble on people; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
very like, I may find the best way is to drop into the water
some night, and let the river carry my poor dust out to
sea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t the pluck to do that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Anyway,
you belong to him now, and have got to play the
game and stick to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They argued for some time, the man minatory and
harsh, the woman resigned. But once he amused her.
Then Ned harked back to her threat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You talk of being down on your luck, and suicide, and
all that twaddle. But you never looked better in your
life. You&rsquo;re bursting with health.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; she cried indignantly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve no right
to say it. And if I am, what about you? You&rsquo;re a lot
fatter and handsomer than ever you was in my time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a lie,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and you needn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m
made of stone, though you are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I&rsquo;m a stone, &rsquo;tis a rolling one,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;and
that sort don&rsquo;t gather no moss. I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;ve met you,
Ned, because I&rsquo;m very wishful for you to know, for your
peace of mind, I&rsquo;m not happy&mdash;far, far from it. You
deserve to know that. You made me laugh just now, I
grant, and that&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve laughed since I left
you&mdash;God judge me, if it isn&rsquo;t. The very first time,
and the sound was so strange that it made me jump.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Laugh? You haven&rsquo;t got much to laugh at I should
say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. I&rsquo;ll never laugh no more. I wouldn&rsquo;t
laugh when I might&mdash;now it&rsquo;s too late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s never too late for anything for one of your sort.
And when you say you&rsquo;re a rolling stone, I reckon you tell
the truth for once. And things that roll go down hill,
remember that. Hell knows where you&rsquo;ll roll to before
you finish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be your fault, Ned. You&rsquo;ve got nothing to
blame yourself with,&rdquo; she answered humbly, and he judged
wrongly of what was in her mind.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better send Kellock along to me,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;The business is in hand, and I may tell you, I meant to
hit him as hard as I knew how. But there&rsquo;s two sides to
that, and in the long run what kept me from getting a
gallows out of him is the same that&rsquo;s going to keep me
from getting damages. And that&rsquo;s you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not worthy to black your boots, Ned,&rdquo; declared
Medora.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, and more&rsquo;s he&mdash;more&rsquo;s he; mind that. You
thought he was the clever, strong man&mdash;the sort of man
would be a tower of strength to any woman, and all the
rest of it; and now you know, or you jolly soon will know,
that he&rsquo;s only a tower of strength for himself&mdash;not for
you. A man like him wants a woman to match him, and
if you ask yourself if you match him, and answer yourself
honest, if you can, then you&rsquo;ll answer that you don&rsquo;t and
never will. You can send him to me at my convenience.
He can call o&rsquo; Monday at half-after eight&mdash;then I&rsquo;ll decide
about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Ned. It&rsquo;s more than we deserve, I dare
say. I don&rsquo;t care much what happens now if you can
forgive me. I suppose you can&rsquo;t, but it would mean a
lot to me if you could.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think I&rsquo;ve got something to forgive, then?
That&rsquo;s surprising. I thought &rsquo;twas all the other way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So did I,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;but I know better now. I
shouldn&rsquo;t be suffering like I am if I&rsquo;d done right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can do right and still suffer,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;and
now be off, and send the man to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Medora, again weeping freely, and leaving her bunch of
flowers on the ground at his feet, departed without any
more words. For once, her tears were real and her sorrows
genuine. They were genuine, yet contained a measure
of sweetness, and comforted her by their reality.
This was an order of grief that she had not known. She
persisted in it for a long time, after she had gone out of
his sight, and found a sunny spot among the bluebells.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
There she sat and heaped reproaches on her head; and
self-blame was a sensation so novel that it soothed instead
of crushed her. But this phase passed in contemplation
of Ned. He had changed in some mysterious way. He
was formidable, masculine&mdash;a thing infinitely superior to
herself. Could she dare to say that Ned was now superior
to Kellock? She fled from that thought as from chaos;
but it pursued her; it made to itself feet and wings, and
clung to her mind. She resisted, but it stuck like a burr.
Ned was surely translated into something fine and admirable;
while Kellock, now about to be a conqueror, had
waned almost to a second-rate being in Medora&rsquo;s vision.</p>

<p>A sensation of physical sickness overtook her before
this horrible discovery; for what could such a conclusion
do but wreck her future utterly and hopelessly? If
Kellock were to fall from his pedestal, who was left?</p>

<p>And a hundred yards off, still buried in the thoughts
sprung from this remarkable conversation, Ned set up
his rod, cast out ground bait, and began to fish for dace
and perch. His mind, however, was far from his float,
and presently his eyes followed Medora, as she moved
pensively along the road on the other side of the pond.
She would tell Kellock to come and see him, and then
Ned would&mdash;he did not know what he would do.</p>

<p>His thoughts turned to Philander Knox and their last
interview. Medora had said nothing to contradict the
vatman&rsquo;s assurances. Indeed, she had implicitly supported
them. And she was obviously changed. She had
apparently enough proper feeling to be miserable; but
whether that misery was pretended, or sprang from her
conscience, or arose from her futile conjunction with Kellock
under the present unsupportable conditions, Ned could
not determine. He examined his own emotions respecting
Medora, and found that she had slightly modified them.
He despised her, and began even to pity her, since, on her
own showing, she was having a bad time. But was she
ever built to have a good time? Dingle doubted it.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXV<br />

<small>THE EXPLANATION</small></h2></div>


<p>After the medley of emotions awakened by her meeting
with her husband, no solid foundation remained to Medora&rsquo;s
mind. Indeed, everything solid seemed to crumble
before the apparition of Ned so close; before all the
little familiar marks of him, his mannerisms, his vibrant
voice, his virility, the flushing colour on his cheeks, the
masculine sound and sight of him. Against that vision,
which haunted her pillow at Priory Farm, arose the spectacle
of Kellock&mdash;the difference between a stout, shadow-casting
man and one himself a shadow. Kellock was a
great hero still (she clave to that), but none the less he
had become something spectral for her. Ned she knew&mdash;her
recent meeting reminded her how well; but Kellock
she did not know, and from that long night of thought
there emerged one steadfast emotion: she began to cease
to want to know. Perception of this startling indifference
frightened Medora. It was half-past four o&rsquo;clock in
the morning, and an early thrush already sang when she
made this discovery. She shivered at such a sentiment,
set it down to hunger, and so arose and descended to the
larder. She ate and slept, and in the morning told her
mother of the talk with Dingle.</p>

<p>They walked together to Dene, and before Lydia went
to the rag house, she had heard disquieting things. It
was not the facts that concerned her, for they were to
the good. That Ned wished to see Kellock and had determined
not to claim damages, comforted Mrs. Trivett,
for that argued an intention on Ned&rsquo;s part to be done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
with the matter, and take such steps as should enable her
daughter to marry at the earliest opportunity permitted
by law; but it was Medora&rsquo;s attitude to Dingle that surprised
her, and as she reached the Mill, she voiced her
astonishment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll keep me &rsquo;mazed to my dying day, I reckon,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;My own daughter, and yet never, never do
you do, or say, or look at things how I should expect.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter now then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s right you should feel obliged to your late husband&mdash;I&rsquo;m
not wondering at that. But now&mdash;just
because you talked to him, and he behaved like the man
he is, and spoke sense and didn&rsquo;t break your neck, as some
men might&mdash;just because of that, you seem to have
turned round and&mdash;and&mdash;well, to hear you this morning
one would think you and Ned&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Medora quite understood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Funny you should say that. I know just what you
mean. It came over me in the night. I got looking back
a lot, and I couldn&rsquo;t help feeling, when he stood there talking
to me in the old way&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t help feeling that
he&rsquo;d got his side after all. I dare say I didn&rsquo;t quite understand
his point of view, or how I looked from it.
You&rsquo;ve got to be fair, mother. It was as if all that
fearful time, when we drifted apart, had been ruled out
for the minute, and we were back at the starting place.
I took all he said in a very proper and patient spirit;
and if you ask him, he&rsquo;ll tell you I did. And he didn&rsquo;t
mince words either. And I very much wish for you to see
him as soon as you can, and tell him that I greatly value
his advice, and that my eyes were opened for the first time
to my fatal conduct. And, being a fair woman, I&rsquo;ve got
to admit that I used him badly, along of some weakness in
myself I never knew was there; and I think he was more
kind about it than I deserved. Please see he hears that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what price, Jordan?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Trivett.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This has nothing to do with Jordan. I&rsquo;m going to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
see him now and explain that he must visit Ned at once;
and I hope he&rsquo;ll feel properly grateful to Ned for his
goodness to me. He ought.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lydia&rsquo;s head swam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see, mother, that Ned is&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see nothing,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Trivett. &ldquo;This
is all beyond me. You&rsquo;re right to be obliged to him&mdash;well
you may be; but, for God&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t go blowing
Ned&rsquo;s trumpet to your future husband, else&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to be narrow-minded about Ned,&rdquo; answered
Medora calmly. &ldquo;You can leave it to me. I
shall certainly tell Jordan the way I was treated.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, Medora had quite forgotten the
way she had been treated. For reasons far beyond her
power to explain&mdash;since it was her quality to avoid directness
at any cost&mdash;she ignored and put out of her
mind the very harsh things Mr. Dingle had said. She
banished them, and chose rather to dwell on what she
regarded as the spirit and general essence created by their
meeting. Detail might be dismissed, and it was very
characteristic of Medora that when, presently, she met
Jordan in the dinner hour, and took him up the valley,
and rested her eyes on the spot beside the lake where she
had listened to Mr. Dingle, she created a suggestion of
that interview for the benefit of Kellock amazingly unlike
the real thing.</p>

<p>The vatman ate his bread and cheese as he walked beside
her and saw her on the way homeward to her own
meal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When are you coming back?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got
the lecture dead right now, and I&rsquo;d like to run it over once
more. I&rsquo;ve learned the typewriter myself too, and can
give you a start and a beating at it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s wonderful to me how you can fasten on a thing
like that, while all my future hangs in the balance,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a bit of startling news, Jordan. I ran
on top of Mr. Dingle yesterday. I was just picking a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
bunch of flowers and wondering when something would
happen when&mdash;there he was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;D&rsquo;you mean he stopped you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He did. I was shrinking past the man; but that
wouldn&rsquo;t do. He spoke, and I couldn&rsquo;t believe my ears,
for I&rsquo;d got to think he was my black angel, naturally
enough. But instead of anything like that, he let the
dead past bury the past in a very gentlemanly manner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I stood in a dream to hear his familiar voice,
just friendly and kind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Friendly and kind!&rsquo;&rdquo; exclaimed Kellock. &ldquo;When
was he ever friendly and kind to you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Before&mdash;before we fell out. It was like going back
to the old, old days, before he turned on me and drove
me to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s learned his lesson then. That&rsquo;s to the good.
But what had he to say to you? It&rsquo;s for us to talk to him
now. And it&rsquo;s for him to act, not to talk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He knows all that. Anything like the reasonableness
of the man you never heard. I couldn&rsquo;t believe my ears.
He&rsquo;s not going to do anything wrong&mdash;far from it. He
wants to see you on Monday evening at half-past eight,
please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. He&rsquo;s turned it all over in his mind, and seen
his mistakes and regrets the sad past.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you know he does?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He said so, and, with all his faults, he&rsquo;s quite as truthful
as you are, Jordan. And to show it, he&rsquo;s not going
to do anything about damages. He feels that wouldn&rsquo;t
be right. He&rsquo;s a very just man. He didn&rsquo;t only say
things I was glad to hear either. He told me some bitter
truths. He said that I&rsquo;d never be the right wife for you,
Jordan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you let him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t. I wasn&rsquo;t going to hear that, of course.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
But he&rsquo;s got a brain&mdash;more than we thought&mdash;and he
said that to a man of your disposition&mdash;but if I&rsquo;m going
to vex you, I&rsquo;ll leave that alone. Only don&rsquo;t think he
spoke unkindly. And when you consider what it meant
to him my leaving him&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did he say about my disposition?&rdquo; interrupted
Kellock. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a right to know that before I see him,
Medora.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He said that you&rsquo;ve got a mind far above women&mdash;that
a wife to you would be less than what a wife is to an
ordinary man. Because you&rsquo;re all intellect and great
thoughts for the welfare of everybody, so that the welfare
of one, even your own wife, would be a small thing by comparison.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How little he knows!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I told him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She proceeded and surprised Kellock further.</p>

<p>&ldquo;D&rsquo;you mean,&rdquo; he asked presently, &ldquo;that he could stop
you in the open road and talk like this and say all these
wise things, as if he was your brother? It&rsquo;s contrary to
nature, and I don&rsquo;t understand it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;More did I,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I felt in a dream about
it. He might have been a brother. That&rsquo;s the very word.
And last night, as I lay and thought, it came into my
head in a very curious way that between you and him as
things are, I&rsquo;ve got two brothers and no husband at all.
And God knows, Jordan, if it wouldn&rsquo;t be better to leave
it at that, and let me go free. For if I could win the
respect of two such men as you and him by stopping as
I am and being wife of neither, it might turn out a lot
better for all three of us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stared in deep amazement. He flung away the remains
of his meal and stood still with his mouth open.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are all women like you?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Upon my soul,
I wonder sometimes&mdash;but this&mdash;it&rsquo;s all so unlike what
goes on in a man&rsquo;s mind&mdash;where are we? Where are we?
You always seem to leave me guessing.&rdquo;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose I can make you see, dear Jordan.
I&rsquo;ve had hours and hours to think about it. You come
to it fresh. Of course, it sounds strange to you for the
minute. You must allow for the surprise. I&rsquo;m only a
woman, and, what with one thing and another, I&rsquo;ve been
that driven and harried lately that my mind is all in a
whirl. It&rsquo;ll come right no doubt. He&rsquo;s not going to claim
damages. That&rsquo;s one certainty, and that ought to comfort
you. And I think when you see him, at his orders&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;His orders&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, my dear man, do be reasonable. You jump
down my throat so! It&rsquo;s no good questioning every word
I say. It makes me despair. I haven&rsquo;t got your flow
of language, and if I can&rsquo;t pick my words, you needn&rsquo;t
quarrel about them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not picking a quarrel, Medora; I&rsquo;m only saying
there&rsquo;s no question of his orders. I&rsquo;ll see him certainly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And thank him, I should hope. I dare say he&rsquo;d have
had a lot of money out of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As to thanking him&mdash;however, it&rsquo;s no good arguing.
Leave that for the present. You can trust me to take
the right line with Mr. Dingle. When are you coming
back? They&rsquo;re going to meet me about the house if I
can take it for three years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three years is a long time, Jordan. You might
want to go to London before that. I dare say your lecture
will get you into notice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His eye brightened. Here at last was solid ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be back at the inn before then. There&rsquo;s a
pretty good lot coming. I rather want to rehearse it to
you and a man or two from the Mill one evening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come back, of course, the minute I can; but&mdash;I
want to tell you, Jordan, I&rsquo;m not coming to the lecture.
I&rsquo;ve got my reasons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again he was left without foothold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not coming to my lecture, Medora?&rdquo;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>&ldquo;No. You always said we must help and not hinder
each other, and that marriage is a co-operation, or nothing.
And I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s better, where we don&rsquo;t think alike,
to respect each other&rsquo;s opinions and go our own way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;you mean? You&rsquo;ve said you see eye to eye
with me in everything. You&rsquo;ve never questioned the substance
of the lecture.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t for me to question it. But I don&rsquo;t agree
with a lot of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since when?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since first I heard it. I wasn&rsquo;t brought up to feel
everybody&rsquo;s equal, and I don&rsquo;t believe they are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say they are. What I say is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know what you say, Jordan. It&rsquo;s no good arguing.
You&rsquo;d hate me if I was false and pretended anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where do you disagree then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t believe in fighting and taking their money
from people. I want peace. If you could see what my
life is in this storm of doubt and uncertainty, if you could
sympathise with a woman in my position who has given up
so much, then you&rsquo;d surely understand that I&rsquo;ve got no
heart for all these theories and ideas at present.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re getting away from the point,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t argue with you because you won&rsquo;t stick to the subject.
I do sympathise&mdash;all the time&mdash;every minute;
but my lecture doesn&rsquo;t belong to our private affairs. It
doesn&rsquo;t alter them, or delay them. I&rsquo;m going on with that
as quick as Dingle will let me. But I want you to come
to the lecture. I ask it, and I expect it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t any right to do that. I don&rsquo;t ask you
to come to church, so you oughtn&rsquo;t to ask me to come to
your lecture. We must be ourselves, and where we don&rsquo;t
agree, we mustn&rsquo;t be afraid to say so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is their work at the farm,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;Your
uncle&rsquo;s a benighted, ignorant man, and my ideas terrify
him, and so he&rsquo;s tried to influence you. And I&rsquo;m sorry
to find he has succeeded.&rdquo;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>&ldquo;Not at all. Uncle Tom would influence nobody; and
if you think he&rsquo;d influence me, that shows you don&rsquo;t respect
me as you ought, or give me credit for my brains&mdash;though
you&rsquo;ve praised them often enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I give you credit for everything. You&rsquo;re half my life,
and the best half, I should hope. And I trust you to
change your mind about this, Medora. It&rsquo;s the biggest
thing that&rsquo;s ever happened to me, and I think if you turn
it over, you&rsquo;ll see you ought to be there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought I was the biggest thing that had ever happened
to you. However&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leave it&mdash;don&rsquo;t decide yet. I&rsquo;m proud. I wouldn&rsquo;t
have you come, of course, if it&rsquo;s not going to interest you.
Whether you agree, or whether you don&rsquo;t, I should have
thought my first public appearance would mean a lot to
you&mdash;me being what I am to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It does mean a lot&mdash;so much that I&rsquo;d be so cruel
nervous that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you said the reason&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if you knew how you&rsquo;re making
my head ache, Jordan. Leave it alone, for God&rsquo;s sake.
I&rsquo;ll come, of course, if you&rsquo;re going to make it a personal
thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not if you don&rsquo;t feel it a personal thing. Come back
to me soon, and we&rsquo;ll have a good long talk about it.
There mustn&rsquo;t be any difference between us. We&rsquo;re too
much to each other for anything like that. And don&rsquo;t
see Mr. Dingle again, please, Medora, till I have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not likely to see him again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They had walked round to the top of the &ldquo;Corkscrew&rdquo;
by this time, and now the bell sounded below that told
the dinner hour was ended.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must be gone,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Fix your day for coming
back, Medora, and Mrs. Trivett will tell me to-morrow.
The sooner the better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to come as quickly as they&rsquo;ll let me,&rdquo; she answered.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>Doubt and care were in the young man&rsquo;s eyes. A rare
emotion touched him, and there was something yearning
in his voice as he stood and held her hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let any shadow rise between us,&rdquo; he begged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not; why should it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He put his arms round her, and to her surprise kissed
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-bye&mdash;take care of yourself and come back
quickly. I won&rsquo;t bother you about the lecture any more,&rdquo;
he promised.</p>

<p>Then he ran down the hill, and Medora watched him go.
She was regretting the kiss. When she had hungered for
kisses, they did not come. Such a thing now was insipid&mdash;fruit
over-ripe, doubtful as a delicacy past its season.
She believed that she had frightened him into this display
of emotion. His promise not to trouble her again about
the lecture was also a sign of weakness. She thawed, and
felt almost sorry for him. Jordan was growing fainter,
it seemed to her. His outlines began to blur even after a
few days&rsquo; absence from him. An overpowering desire to
see Ned again oppressed her.</p>

<small>THE STROKE</small></h2></div>


<p>Medora&rsquo;s native instinct, to fight for her own hand at the
expense of the community, now held some strife with her
appreciation of what Kellock had done and suffered on
her account. At first a sense of justice strove to remind
her of their relations and of Jordan&rsquo;s views with respect to
her and her future. She was, in fact, as he had declared,
his paramount thought and first object in life. And this
he felt without any diminution of his personal ambitions.
But he had supposed, and she had given him every reason
to suppose, that his ambitions and hers were one; that she
desired nothing better than to help him in his propagandist
work. During the earliest days of their association in
London, this had been her purpose and assurance; but it
was so no longer. The artificial existence with Kellock
had knocked all the poetry out of their relation, and his
aspirations now found her averse. Because Kellock could
not understand what made life worth living to her, Medora&rsquo;s
interest and loyalty alike were withered.</p>

<p>Yet now she put up a struggle for him and it lasted
longer than might have been expected. Indeed, it endured
for twenty-four hours, until the morning following upon a
sleepless night. Then her chivalry and general vague
sense of her obligations went down before what she believed,
perhaps rightly, was her common sense. She began to see,
with a dazzle of conviction, that Kellock was not at all the
husband for her; but her woman&rsquo;s wit put it differently:
she assured her soul that she was not the wife for Kellock.
This step once taken, those that followed were exceedingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
swift, and they appeared first in a conversation, not with
the man she desired to meet, but with another. For the
present she concealed her new impressions from her family,
but on the following Sunday, Mr. Knox came to tea, and
was pleasant and agreeable, according to his custom. Tom
and Mary Dolbear, gratified to observe the large philosophy
with which he had taken his defeat, welcomed him and
forgot the hard things they had said and thought about
him.</p>

<p>Then, as the hour came for the visitor to return home,
Medora made an excuse to accompany him. She was going
into Dene to see Daisy Finch and have supper with her
and her mother&mdash;so she said; and together they went
their way.</p>

<p>She wasted no time with Mr. Knox, and having told him
what she hungered to tell, changed her mind about Daisy
Finch, and went home again. Upon the whole, Mr. Knox
disappointed her at this meeting, yet looking back over
their conversation, she felt not sorry it had taken place,
though her face burned a little when she considered the full
weight of some of the vatman&rsquo;s remarks. He did not spare
her; but she began to get accustomed to hard words now,
and her sagacity told Medora that where there was blame,
there was hope. To be past censure is to be past forgiveness.</p>

<p>She began at once to Mr. Knox upon the subject of her
husband, and her second sentence indicated the vast strides
that her ambition had made. The whole picture of Medora&rsquo;s
future in her own eyes was now changed. The new
vision looked wild indeed, and made even Medora wince a
little to hear it in her own tongue; yet it did not astonish
Philander as much as she imagined, though she had reached
it sooner than he expected her to do so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see Mr. Dingle sometimes, don&rsquo;t you, Mr. Knox?&rdquo;
began Medora.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do, my dear, and you mustn&rsquo;t object if I say I think
very well of him. Curiously enough I think a lot of Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
Kellock, too. Each have got very good points in his way,
and you can learn from them as well as teach them. Of
course, it&rsquo;s a ticklish business being friends with both, but
so I am, and hope to continue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, then, implore of Ned not to divorce
me! Oh, Mr. Knox, you&rsquo;re wise and old, but you may still
remember what it was to be young. Everything&rsquo;s gone if
he divorces me&mdash;everything. I&rsquo;ve been pixy-led, fooled&mdash;yes,
I have. And I&rsquo;ve ruined two good men, through no
fault of theirs, or mine. It wasn&rsquo;t Kellock&rsquo;s fault, nor yet
Ned&rsquo;s; and I&rsquo;ll swear on my knees it wasn&rsquo;t mine&mdash;not
altogether, because something not myself drove me and
blinded me and dazed me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s moonshine, Medora. You&rsquo;re not going to
make anybody believe that; and don&rsquo;t you try&mdash;else
there&rsquo;ll be the devil to pay. It was your fault&mdash;the fault
of your character&mdash;because a woman and her character
must be one. But I grant this; if we can&rsquo;t go outside our
characters, and our characters are us and control all we
do and think, then, being yourself from no fault of your
own, you&rsquo;re not to blame in a sense. Then, again, that
won&rsquo;t wash either, because if nobody can do anything outside
their characters, then nobody&rsquo;s ever to blame in themselves
for anything they do, and there&rsquo;s no such thing as
wickedness in the world. Which is nonsense and moonshine
again, because we very well know the world&rsquo;s full of
wickedness. So it&rsquo;s no good saying, or fooling yourself to
think, that you&rsquo;ve not been very wicked indeed, because you
have. However, like a lot of bigger people than you,
you&rsquo;ve got less, so far, than you deserve, because the punishment
never does fit the evil deed, any more than the
reward fits the good one, except in fairy tales. In other
words, Kellock, being what he is&mdash;a man of the highest
possible conduct, with a frosty nature to help it&mdash;has
saved your bacon so far. You know what I mean. Therefore,
there&rsquo;s a ray of hope&mdash;not very bright, in my opinion,
still, a ray.&rdquo;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>&ldquo;Thank Heaven you think so,&rdquo; said Medora.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only my opinion, mind, and I may very likely be
wrong; but I&rsquo;m a man that sees hope very often where another
cannot. A wonderful eye for hope I&rsquo;ve got. And if
your husband knew all the facts and heard&mdash;not that
you&rsquo;d been pixy-led, but that you was properly ashamed of
your infamous, hard-hearted, senseless, worthless way of
going on, and meant to do better for evermore&mdash;luck
offering, and the Lord helping&mdash;if he heard that, it&rsquo;s just
on the cards he might give it a second thought. I don&rsquo;t
say he would. I wouldn&rsquo;t in his case&mdash;not for a moment;
but he&rsquo;s himself&mdash;an amazingly large-minded man.
So, out of regard for your mother, Medora, I&rsquo;ll venture to
touch the subject.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bless your name for evermore if you do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Allow yourself no hope, however. You&rsquo;ve got to think
of Jordan Kellock, and I tell you frankly I wouldn&rsquo;t move
in this matter if I didn&rsquo;t reckon he was utterly mistaken in
his opinion of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is, he is, Mr. Knox! I&rsquo;m far ways less than what
he fancied.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are; but don&rsquo;t waste your time eating dirt to me,
though you ought to do it all round, no doubt, and heap
ashes on your head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know I ought; and Jordan&rsquo;s going to see Ned on
Monday evening, so if you, in your great wisdom, could
talk to my husband first&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will do so,&rdquo; promised Mr. Knox, and he kept his word.
It happened, therefore, that when the hour arrived for the
meeting of Kellock and Dingle, much had fallen out beyond
the former&rsquo;s knowledge.</p>

<p>Jordan had, of course, been left with plenty to think
about by Medora, but since the future was accomplished in
his judgment, and its details only a matter of time, he was
concerned with far larger questions than agitated her
mind. His thoughts ran on to the day when they would
be married and their lives mingle happily, to run henceforth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
in a single channel. He had never felt fear of that day
after once winning her; and he had, until this moment,
enjoyed full confidence that they were one in thought and
ambition already, only waiting for the completion and
crowning of marriage to establish their unity in the face of
the world. But Medora had shaken the ingredients of
this conviction at their last meeting, and Jordan felt uneasy.
If she could speak so strongly on the subject of his
lecture, what might she not presently say on the subject of
his life? A disloyal thought once crossed his mind; something
whispered that her objection to hearing the lecture
was humbug. The voice hinted that from no conviction
did Medora hold back, since she had already explicitly accepted
his fixed principles, and avowed herself their supporter.
The voice furthermore ventured to suggest that
fixed principles and the lady were never to be mentioned
in one breath by any rational observer. But Kellock protested
against such insinuations, and continued to seek a
reason for her refusal. He could find none, and was forced
to accept her own. He was constrained to believe that
she actually had changed her opinions, and the reflection
that she must never be expected to support him with unqualified
enthusiasm cast Jordan down. He did not despair
of Medora, but felt that he would be called to do all
over again what he had hoped was already done. He
must convince her that he was right and weary not until she
had come over to his views. After marriage, her mind
would gradually take its colour from him, if the operation
were conducted painlessly. He satisfied himself that this
would happen, and had thought himself into a contented
spirit when he went to see Dingle.</p>

<p>Ned said little, and the interview was extraordinary. It
did not take long, yet sent Kellock reeling out into the
night bewildered, shocked, with the whole scheme of his
future existence threatened, and no immediate possibility
to retrieve the position.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve come, then,&rdquo; began Mr. Dingle. &ldquo;Well, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
good bit has happened since I saw you last, and, things
being what they are here, it looks rather as if I might
return to the Mill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t heard nothing of that,&rdquo; answered Jordan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t mention it; but Mr. Trenchard is quite
willing if I see no objection&mdash;so Ernest Trood tells me&mdash;and
I imagine you&rsquo;d have nothing to say against it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As to that, your plans are not my business. Of
course, that might alter my own plans.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, your plans are not my business. In fact, we
needn&rsquo;t trouble much about each other in any case.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jordan reflected.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it wouldn&rsquo;t be natural, though I bear no malice,
and I hope you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have I shown malice?&rdquo; asked the beaterman. &ldquo;Have
I taken this outrage in a malicious spirit?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve taken it lying down, and you know it; and I dare
say, at the bottom of your heart, you&rsquo;ve been more than a
bit surprised sometimes to see how I held in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a thinking, reasonable being.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were you? You&rsquo;re not surprised at the line I took,
because I did pretty much what you would have done if
the positions had been reversed, and I had run away with
your wife. But I should have thought you had wit to
marvel a bit how a man like me took it so tame. If I
could knock you into the water for advising me to be kinder
to her, didn&rsquo;t it ever strike you I might have done even a
bit more when you stole the woman?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As to that, I&rsquo;ve understood up to the present you
meant to do a bit more. It was made clear to me you were
going for damages along with the divorce.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought of it, and I could have got them, no doubt;
but what held my hand off you when this happened, holds
it still. I&rsquo;m not going to claim damages.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kellock was silent for some moments, arguing with himself
whether he ought to thank Ned for this concession, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
not. He decided against so doing; but felt it right to explain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You might think I ought to thank you for that. But
I don&rsquo;t, because, if I did, it would be admitting you had
waived what was your right. But I deny you had any
right to do such a thing as to try and take my money.
Your wife left you of her own free will, and on her own
judgment, and came to me, and though the law&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We needn&rsquo;t worry about nonsense like that,&rdquo; interrupted
Ned. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a bigger thing than that to say.
You&rsquo;re so great upon defying the law, and getting everything
your own way, and you know so much better than
everyone else, the law included, how life should be run, and
how we should all behave, that you&rsquo;ve rather defeated your
own object, Kellock. I dare say some people would think
it funny what I&rsquo;m going to say; but you won&rsquo;t. In fact,
you&rsquo;ve been hoist with your own bomb, as the saying is,
and the reason I didn&rsquo;t go to quod for you is just your
own defiance of law. You saved yourself some ugly punishment
at the time; but only to get worse at the finish.
So what happened was you disobeyed the law, not me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is all a foreign language to me,&rdquo; answered
Jordan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it? Well, you&rsquo;ll see the English of it in half a
minute. The good of three people hangs to this, and
when I tell you that in my opinion all three will be the
losers by your marrying Medora, perhaps you&rsquo;ll begin to
see where I&rsquo;m getting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As to that, you&rsquo;ll do well to mind your own business.
I can brook no interference from you between me and
Medora.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t so much what you can brook, as what is going
to happen. You&rsquo;ve taken a very high-minded line about
Medora, Kellock&mdash;so wonderful high-minded, in fact, that
you&rsquo;ve got left altogether. You deserve to have a halo and
a pair of wings for what you&rsquo;ve done&mdash;so Philander Knox
said, and I quite agree. But you don&rsquo;t deserve to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
Medora. And you&rsquo;re not going to have Medora. You
said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll treat this woman with all proper respect, and
all that, till I can marry her&rsquo;; and that showed you to be
a very decent man according to your own lights; and when
I heard about it, I spared you; but there&rsquo;s another side.
I can&rsquo;t divorce Medora now, because I&rsquo;ve got nothing to
divorce her for&mdash;see? You might think I ought to help
you to hoodwink the law in the matter, for the sake of
honour and decency&mdash;things for which the law has got
no use. And I would willingly enough for some people,
but not for you. Because what you&rsquo;ve done shows a lot of
other things&mdash;chief being that Medora and you never
would get on, really&mdash;not as husband and wife. Even
as brother and sister, there&rsquo;s been a lot of friction lately,
so I hear; and what would it be if you were married? So,
you see, when I say you don&rsquo;t deserve Medora, Kellock,
I&rsquo;m not saying anything particular unkind. In fact, the
truth is that a man with your nice and superior opinions
can&rsquo;t marry another man&rsquo;s wife&mdash;not according to law.
You ought to have thought of that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not too late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, it is&mdash;much too late. You can&rsquo;t go wrong
now, even if you thought of such a thing; which you never
could. You&rsquo;re damned well out of it in fact; and the
longer you live, the better you&rsquo;ll be pleased with yourself,
I dare say. The divorce laws may be beneath contempt
and only fit for gorillas; but, while they are the laws,
you&rsquo;ve got to abide by &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jordan Kellock stared with round, horrified eyes. Even
in his dismay and grief he could wonder how the simple
Ned had reached this high present standpoint, and was
able to address him like a father lecturing a child. He
began to recognise the hand of Mr. Knox.</p>

<p>Now he pulled himself together, rose, and prepared to
be gone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can only imagine that others have helped you to this
extraordinary decision, Dingle.&rdquo;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t deny it. I never was one to think I could run
my own show, or play a lone hand. A pity you didn&rsquo;t
feel the same. A lone hand always comes to grief. You
talk to Philander Knox about this. He&rsquo;s a great admirer
of yours. But he&rsquo;s looked at it from the outside, as a
student of character. He&rsquo;s got no axe to grind about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Medora?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care a cuss about her. As to her line, you&rsquo;d
better inquire at headquarters. I haven&rsquo;t seen her again,
and don&rsquo;t much want to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This flings her on to the mercy of society, Dingle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, society won&rsquo;t eat her. Society&rsquo;s pretty merciful,
so far as I can see. You talk it over with her, and get
her views of the situation&mdash;whatever they may be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll only ask one question. Does she know that you
don&rsquo;t intend to divorce her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She does not. I only decided myself half an hour
before you called.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it possible for me to prevail with you to change your
mind, Mr. Dingle?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; because with your views of what&rsquo;s straight and
honourable, you won&rsquo;t try. You know I can&rsquo;t divorce her.
Why? Because you was too good and clean a man to
make it possible. So long. Just you think over all I&rsquo;ve
said. You don&rsquo;t know your luck yet, but you will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jordan Kellock went out into the darkness, and he staggered
like a man in drink. He tottered down the hill from
Ashprington, and intended to start then and there for
Cornworthy and Medora; but he found himself physically
unequal to any such pilgrimage. His knees shook and his
muscles were turned to wool. He walked to the inn, ascended
to bed, and lay phantom-ridden through the hours
of an interminable night. The shock of what he had
heard was so great that his mind was too stunned to
measure it. A situation, that demanded deepest reflection
by its own horror, robbed him of the power to reflect. He
lay and panted like a wounded animal. He could not think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
by reason of the force of his feelings. He could only lick
his smarting wounds. Then he fell into genuine grief for
Medora&rsquo;s plight. Actual physical symptoms intruded.
He found his eyes affected and strange movements in his
heart and stomach. His hands shook in the morning, and
he cut himself shaving&mdash;a thing that he had not done for
years. He could not eat, yet suffered from a sensation of
emptiness. Daylight by no means modified his sense of
loss and chaos. It found him before all things desirous to
see Medora; but, by the time he was up and dressed, this
purpose failed him for a season, and his thoughts were occupied
with Knox. Then he turned again to Medora, and
felt that life must be suspended until he could see her and
break to her what had happened. It was now too late to
visit Cornworthy until the day&rsquo;s work should be done, and
remembering how often work had saved a situation, solved
a problem and helped him through difficult hours, Kellock
proceeded to the Mill, and was thankful to be there. He
felt that labour would calm his nerves, restore his balance,
and assist him, before the evening came, to survey his situation
in the light of this convulsion. He found himself
entirely interested in what Medora would do; and he believed
that he knew. His heart bled for her.</p>

<p>Thus absorbed, he reached the vat. He was engaged
upon the largest sheets of drawing-paper at the time&mdash;work
calling for more than average lifting power and muscular
energy&mdash;and he was glad that now, for a while,
work must take the first demand upon mind and body alike.</p>

<p>The vats were full, and the machinery hummed overhead;
coucher and layer stood at their places, and Jordan, slipping
his deckle upon the mould, grasped it with thumb on
edge, and sank it into the pulp.</p>

<p>Elsewhere Knox, Robert Life and others had taken up
their positions at the breast of the vats with their assistants
about them, and the work of paper-making went on
its immemorial way.</p>

<p>Then that happened that was long remembered&mdash;an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
incident of interest and concern for the many, a tragedy
for the one. Kellock brought up his mould, and instead
of proceeding with the rhythmic actions to right and left&mdash;those
delicate operations of exquisite complexity where
brain telegraphed to muscle, and motor and sensory nerves
both played their part in the completion of the &ldquo;stroke&rdquo;&mdash;instead
of the usual beautiful and harmonious gestures
that drained the mould and laid a sweet, even face of
paper upon it, he found forces invisible at his elbows and
an enemy still more terrible within. His brain hung fire;
a wave of horrible doubt and irresolution swept over him.
It ran through the physical parts engaged&mdash;his arms and
breast muscles and the small of his back. He stared at
the mould, turned and washed off the faulty sheet he had
created, and made an attempt at a jest to Harold Spry,
who was watching, all eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are my wits, Harold?&rdquo; he said. Then he took
a deep breath, and dipped the mould again.</p>

<p>Spry and the layer watched sympathetically. To their
eyes there seemed no failure as Kellock drew up his load;
but he knew. A condition of tremendous tension raised his
heart-beat to a gallop, and his eyes grew misty. He
gasped like a drowning man, and felt the sweat beading
on his forehead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll just get a breath of air and come back,&rdquo; he
said, dropped the mould, and went out of the shop. Spry
washed the mould, then he walked down the line of vats
and spoke to Knox. A man came from the engine house
with a message, and Ernest Trood also entered with some
information for Robert Life. What he heard made him
hasten out of doors to find Kellock sitting up on a form
at the entrance of the vat house with his head in his hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, my son?&rdquo; asked Trood, kindly
enough; but a look at Jordan told him all he feared to
hear.</p>

<p>The young man&rsquo;s expression had changed, and there was
fear in his eyes, as though they had just mirrored some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
awful thing. The resolute, closely-knit Kellock seemed to
have fallen to pieces. Every limb indicated the nerve
storm under which he suffered. Trood was experienced,
and knew the danger. He believed that Kellock had given
in too soon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fight&mdash;fight like hell!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t run away
from it. Don&rsquo;t give it time to get into you. Come back
now, lad&mdash;this minute. At your age, it&rsquo;s nothing&mdash;just
indigestion, or a chill about you. If you let it fester, you&rsquo;ll
go from bad to worse, and very like have to knock off for
six months before you look at a mould again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no good&mdash;it&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; said the younger man; but
he obeyed, and followed Trood into the vat house.</p>

<p>Knox had warned the rest to ignore the sufferer, and no
man took any notice of Kellock as he returned.</p>

<p>Spry was waiting, and greeted him cheerfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re all right again&mdash;your eyes are all right,&rdquo; he
said.</p>

<p>Trood turned his back on Kellock, and everybody was
at work as usual. He made a tremendous effort with himself,
called up his utmost resolution, smiled and nodded to
Spry, who was whistling, gripped his deckle to the mould,
and then strove to think of something else, pursue his business
in the usual mechanical fashion, and let his unconscious
but highly trained energies pursue their road.</p>

<p>But it was not to be. Some link had strained, if not
broken, in the complexus of brain and nerve and muscle.
Perfect obedience was lacking; a rebel had crept into the
organism. For once, the man&rsquo;s expressionless face was
alive with expression; for once his steady and monotonous
voice vibrated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all up,&rdquo; he said to Harold Spry.</p>

<p>Then he put down the mould.</p>

<p>Trood was beside him in an instant, and Knox came also.
Elsewhere those who had no love for Kellock talked under
their breath together. Others, who came and went, took
the news.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>Trood made the vatman try again; but only once. He
saw in a moment that the breakdown could not be bluffed;
the fault in the machine was too deep.</p>

<p>Jordan put on his coat, and Trood arranged to drive
him to Totnes presently to see a doctor. The young man
was calm, but his will power appeared suspended. He
looked into the faces of his companions for any ray of
comfort; and the fact that he could do so was testimony
to his collapse.</p>

<p>He went back to &ldquo;The Waterman&rsquo;s Arms&rdquo; presently;
and through the Mill like lightning flashed the news that
Kellock had lost his stroke.</p>

<small>THE DOCTOR</small></h2></div>


<p>As soon as Mrs. Trivett heard the bad news she stopped
work, explained to her second in command the gravity of
the situation, and hastened home as fast as she could go to
Medora. Now or never might her daughter show what she
was worth, and she felt that her girl&rsquo;s place should be
beside the sufferer. Duty and love alike prompted in that
direction; indeed, Medora herself appeared to view the
disaster with her mother&rsquo;s eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good Lord! Lost his stroke! Poor man,&rdquo; she cried.
&ldquo;I must go to him. Is he ill? Have you seen him?
What was the cause of it? Does he say what he&rsquo;s going
to do about it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen him. He&rsquo;s gone back to the inn, and
Mr. Trood takes him into Totnes presently to the doctor.
And it&rsquo;s your place to go along with them in my opinion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Medora&rsquo;s mind moved swiftly. She knew that Kellock
was to have seen Ned Dingle on the previous evening, and
eagerly she awaited information of what had happened at
that meeting. Jordan intended to have come over to
Priory Farm after working hours; but now she could hear
even sooner than she expected.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t leave him if he&rsquo;s very bad,&rdquo; said Medora.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In no case, better or worse, will you leave him,&rdquo; declared
Lydia. &ldquo;This is a fearful thing to overtake a vatman,
and you, of all people, ought to be at his side to cheer
him and encourage him and help him to hope. It&rsquo;s a nervous
breakdown along of all this waiting and trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;More likely the lecture,&rdquo; suggested Medora. &ldquo;Small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
wonder if his lecture is got on his mind and upset him.
And he was to see Ned yesterday. Perhaps Ned said
something to do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lydia sighed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Things be come to a climax, seemingly. Mr. Knox
whispered to me that Ned might have a bit of good news
for Kellock. On the other hand, perhaps he had not.
Any way, your good is Jordan&rsquo;s good, and his evil is your
evil now; so you&rsquo;d best to get to him as quick as you can,
and stop with him if he wishes you to do so, as he doubtless
will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a couple of hours Medora sat at &ldquo;The Waterman&rsquo;s
Arms.&rdquo; She expected an emotional meeting, and indeed
felt emotional. For a time Jordan&rsquo;s sufferings weighed
with her, and she found sympathy wakening for him. But
he appeared much as usual, and while gratified at her swift
return, held himself well in hand and made no great parade
of his misfortune.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother properly scared me to death,&rdquo; explained Medora.
&ldquo;I do hope to God it&rsquo;s not as bad as she said.
How d&rsquo;you feel, dear? You look pale.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I feel all right in myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that lecture. Why don&rsquo;t you give it up?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Medora. It&rsquo;s nothing to do with the lecture. I
can think of the lecture calmly enough. I&rsquo;m very glad
you came so quick. It&rsquo;s a comfort to me first, and second,
I&rsquo;ve got a lot to tell you. You must brace yourself,
for it&rsquo;s bad news.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;More?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What has lost me my stroke happened last night, Medora.
I saw Mr. Dingle, and I heard more than enough
to put any man off his stroke.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say he&rsquo;s going to take your
money?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My money! Good powers, what&rsquo;s that? He can have
my money to the last penny if he likes. It&rsquo;s far worse.
I hate to say it&mdash;it&rsquo;s enough to kill any pure woman&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>it&rsquo;s
very nearly killed me, I believe; but you&rsquo;ve got to hear
it, Medora, though it sweeps away the firm ground from
under our feet and leaves us without any foothold. He&mdash;he
won&rsquo;t divorce you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She exhibited ample concern at this intelligence. Indeed,
she very nearly fainted in earnest, and Kellock, who
only observed the physical shock, doubted not that it
sprang from emotion entirely creditable to Medora.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can guess what I felt and how I tried to bring
him to a better frame of mind. But he&rsquo;s a different man
from what he used to be. I couldn&rsquo;t believe I was listening
to Dingle. Changed into something outside his real character.
It shows how weak natures can be influenced.
Others have been getting at him&mdash;enemies to us for certain.
It&rsquo;s a cruel, wicked thing, and it knocked me out,
as you see. But I&rsquo;m not concerned with myself. I&rsquo;ve got
to think of you, Medora, and the future&mdash;our future.
Of course, what really hurts the soul of man or woman is
what they inflict upon themselves; but all the same&mdash;there
it is&mdash;if he don&rsquo;t divorce you, where are we?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where we were,&rdquo; she said, and strove to make her
voice sufficiently mournful. But she guessed that it would
be difficult to discuss this tremendous information without
sooner or later revealing her true sentiments.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s talk about it for the present,&rdquo; she continued.
&ldquo;The future will take care of itself&mdash;it always
does. For the minute, I&rsquo;m only troubled about your
health and happiness, Jordan. Whatever comes of this,
we&rsquo;ve been through a great experience, and the end of it
all is this shock to your nerves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The end of it all,&rsquo; Medora?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean, so far as we&rsquo;ve got. You are the only one to
think about for the minute&mdash;not me and not Dingle. The
first thing is your health and strength, and I&rsquo;m not going
to leave you again, Jordan, till you&rsquo;re set up, and find
yourself as clever as ever you were.&rdquo;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>&ldquo;If you come to the lecture, that would go a long way
to quieting my nerves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;ll come. I always meant to come. It was
only a bit of temper saying I wouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;I never thought
not to come. But will you be well enough to give it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. This flurry arose from causes outside the
lecture, and quite outside <i>the</i> Cause. You understand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I do understand, and I&rsquo;m
thankful for it, Jordan; because I know very well it means
much more to you than your own trade. And our little
lives are as nothing to the big things in your mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I never made paper again,&rdquo; he assured her, &ldquo;it
would be less&mdash;far less&mdash;of a grief and disaster to me
than if I was shut off from taking my part in the great
struggle for Labour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do both; you&rsquo;ll do both. It&rsquo;s only a passing
shock. You&rsquo;ll forget all about it, I hope, and be at work
again as well as ever in a few days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so, Medora. As far as that goes, I believe
it&rsquo;s serious. I haven&rsquo;t had time to collect my
thoughts yet, and it&rsquo;s no good worrying till I&rsquo;ve seen the
doctor; but I&rsquo;m none too hopeful. If the stroke once
goes, it wants a lot of careful nursing to get it back, and
often enough it&rsquo;s gone for good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only with men who drink, and that kind of thing.
Such a one as you&mdash;a saint&mdash;and strong in body and
mind, and healthy every way&mdash;of course it will come
back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must be frank with ourselves,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We
must tell the doctor the truth. My stroke was shocked
away. And sometimes what&rsquo;s shocked away can only be
shocked back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s an idea,&rdquo; said Medora.</p>

<p>She was always quick to fasten on ideas and his words
made her thoughtful for a moment. She registered his
statement for future consideration, then flowed on again.
She was cheerful, sympathetic, and full of consolation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
Indeed, presently, as Kellock grew grateful, she began to
think she might be overdoing the part. For it was, if not
wholly, at least in large measure an impersonation now.
She was acting again, and she played with a purpose and
exceeding concern to touch the right note, but avoid overemphasis
upon it. Kellock appeared to be in two minds,
and he looked at her and held her hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to say something,&rdquo; he declared presently;
&ldquo;but I won&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ll keep it off, because I&rsquo;m not very strong
for the moment, and the spoken word once spoken remains.
This is a great crisis all round. I hope good will come out
of trouble, as it often does. We&rsquo;ve had enough to shake
us cruelly to-day&mdash;both of us&mdash;and I won&rsquo;t add to it.
And what&rsquo;s in my thoughts may look different to-morrow,
so I&rsquo;ll keep it there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think any more about anything,&rdquo; she begged
him. &ldquo;Just let your mind rest, or talk about the lecture.
And don&rsquo;t you think, whatever happens, and whatever is in
store for me, that it is going to lessen your great future.
Perhaps it was the strangeness of your ideas that made me
shrink from them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He began to discuss his ruling passion. She kept him
easily to that.</p>

<p>Presently they ate together, and when Ernest Trood
drove up in a dog-cart, lent by Mr. Trenchard, he found
Kellock calm and contented. Medora sat behind, and
joined in the conversation as they trotted through the
green lanes to Totnes.</p>

<p>The master had sent cheering messages to Jordan, and
hoped to see him on the following day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not a bit troubled,&rdquo; said Trood. &ldquo;He reckons
that with a man of your fine physique and constitution&mdash;a
man that lives the life you lead&mdash;this is a flea-bite&mdash;just
a shake-up along of some trifle. And if you&rsquo;ve got to
chuck it and go away for six weeks even, he&rsquo;s not going to
trouble about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like him,&rdquo; said Kellock. &ldquo;But it won&rsquo;t be any question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
of six weeks, or six days, Ernest. I&rsquo;ve got a feeling
about this that I shall be right in twenty-four hours, or not
at all. I&rsquo;m not letting it get on my nerves, you understand.
If it&rsquo;s gone, it&rsquo;s gone. There&rsquo;s plenty of work
for me in the world, whether at the vat, or somewhere else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never heard better sense,&rdquo; answered the foreman.
&ldquo;All the same, don&rsquo;t you throw up the sponge&mdash;that
would be weak. You must remember you&rsquo;re a great paper
maker, Jordan, and there are not any too many of &rsquo;em
left in England now-a-days. So it&rsquo;s up to every man
that&rsquo;s proud of his business to stick to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You take that to heart, Jordan,&rdquo; advised Medora.
&ldquo;Not that there isn&rsquo;t greater work in the world than
paper-making&mdash;we all know that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, we don&rsquo;t know anything of the sort,&rdquo; answered
Trood. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you talk nonsense, Medora, because I
won&rsquo;t hear it. Paper stands for civilisation, and the better
the paper, the higher the civilisation. You&rsquo;d soon see
that if anything happened to spoil paper and raise the
price of rag. If the quality of paper goes down, that&rsquo;s a
sure sign the quality of civilisation&rsquo;s doing the same. By
its paper you can judge a nation, and English paper, being
the best in the world, helps to show we&rsquo;re first in the world.
And if a man like Kellock was to hide his light under a
bushel, his conscience would very soon tell him about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jordan smiled at Mr. Trood&rsquo;s enthusiasm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I love my work,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and should never give it
up, unless it gave me up, Ernest, but for one reason&mdash;that
I could do something better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That you never would, if they made you king of England,&rdquo;
replied the foreman. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d never be so good at
anything else as you are at paper-making, because you&rsquo;ve
got the natural genius for the job. That&rsquo;s your gift&mdash;and
you may lecture or you may stand on your head, or
do any other mortal thing, but you won&rsquo;t do it as well as
you do your work at the vat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctor found not much amiss with Jordan. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
heard all particulars, and made a searching examination of
the patient&rsquo;s fine frame.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never saw a healthier, or more perfect man,&rdquo; he declared.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a long way above the average, and as
healthy as a ten year old. Muscles hypertrophied a bit&mdash;you&rsquo;d
be muscle-bound in fact for any other work but your
own; but your organs are as sound as a bell; there&rsquo;s nothing
whatever to show why you&rsquo;ve broken down. It would
be cruelty to animals to give you physic. What d&rsquo;you
drink and smoke?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I drink water, doctor. I don&rsquo;t smoke.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Might have known it. Well, go away for a fortnight.
Run up to Dartmoor, and walk ten miles a day, or twenty,
if you like. Then you&rsquo;ll be all right. This breakdown
must have been mental, seeing it was nothing else. Have
you got anything on your mind?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get it off then, and you&rsquo;ll be all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kellock nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you very much. I shall soon see a way, I
hope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let a way come then; don&rsquo;t worry to find it. Don&rsquo;t
worry about anything. Go up to Dartmoor&mdash;Dartmoor&rsquo;s
a very good doctor&mdash;though his fees get higher
every year, they tell me. I seem to know your name, by
the way. Where did I see it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Posted up perhaps, doctor. I&rsquo;m going to give a lecture
here next week.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah&mdash;so it was. Socialism&mdash;eh? Is the lecture getting
on your nerves?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not at all. But I hope it&rsquo;ll get on other people&rsquo;s.
I look forward to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, get to Dartmoor, and if your stroke doesn&rsquo;t
come back when you return, see me again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kellock repeated his interview exactly, and Mr. Trood
was much gratified. They went home in the best of spirits,
and that evening Medora devoted to Jordan. He became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
more and more distracted and pre-occupied, however. She
avoided personal subjects, and wanted him to read the lecture
aloud; but this he would not do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now that you are going to hear it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let
you off till then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He declared himself tired and went to his bed before ten
o&rsquo;clock. But he did not sleep. He had much thinking to
do, and many hours elapsed before he arrived at any conclusion.
His mind was entirely occupied with Medora,
and her future caused him to pass through deep anxieties
and fruitless regrets. Her loyal attitude that day had
moved him much, for he supposed that Dingle&rsquo;s decision
must have come upon her with force at least as crushing
as it had fallen on himself. Yet how bravely she had
borne it, how unselfishly she had put it away from her, and
devoted herself to him and his tribulations! Doubtless
now, alone, she too considered the gravity of the situation,
and lay awake in distress.</p>

<p>He had a human impulse to go and comfort her, to declare
that nothing mattered while they shared their great
love, to explain that since Dingle would not legally release
her, they must take the law into their own hands.
But another, and far more characteristic line of thought
developed, and in the dominating and directing forces
awakened by it, he followed his natural bent, and at last
arrived at a decision. He perceived his duty towards
Medora, albeit action appeared impossible until he had
spoken with her. Yet, to put the matter before Medora
might defeat his object, for there could be no doubt that
Medora was his, heart and soul. He felt, therefore, that
he must, after all, act without her knowledge, for he believed
that if she knew his purpose, she would strive to
prevent it.</p>

<small>THE CONFESSION</small></h2></div>


<p>In the evening of Kellock&rsquo;s catastrophe, Philander Knox
saw Ned Dingle, who was working in his garden at the
time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heard the latest?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The latest for me is that Mr. Trenchard will take me
back if I like to come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, the latest for you is that Jordan Kellock&rsquo;s lost his
stroke.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ned dropped a packet of seeds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has he, by God! That&rsquo;s the best news I&rsquo;ve heard for
a good bit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re glad, but you won&rsquo;t be glad if you think
over it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Knox explained the circumstances, and told the tale of
Jordan&rsquo;s failure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor devil,&rdquo; said Ned. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m sorry all the
same. It won&rsquo;t last. He&rsquo;ll get it back, no doubt, and
perhaps he&rsquo;ll see now he can&rsquo;t go playing fast and loose
with people, same as he did, and not get a facer himself
sometimes. I told him I wasn&rsquo;t going to divorce my wife,
and no doubt that&rsquo;s bowled him over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done very well so far, in my opinion,&rdquo; declared
Mr. Knox. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve conducted the affair in a
high-class way, and you and me know where we stand; but
he don&rsquo;t, and more does she.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in your hands,&rdquo; answered Ned. &ldquo;I begin to find
better every day you&rsquo;re right, Knox. And what did she
do when she heard he was down and out?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Took a very proper line,&rdquo; answered Philander.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
&ldquo;Some, feeling what she feels and knowing that she&rsquo;d done
with him, for evermore, whatever happened, would have left
him to stew in his own juice; but Medora, having a very
fine pride, would have despised herself for any such littleness
as that. I see as clear as day what was in her mind.
She said to herself, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been a silly fool, and so has he.
We were lost to sense and reality, and acted in a mad and
improper manner. In fact, we&rsquo;ve been everything we
could be, except wicked, and silliness is often punished
worse than wickedness. But, though Kellock richly deserved
to lose his stroke, it&rsquo;s as much my fault as his own
that he has done so, and I&rsquo;m too sporting to turn my back
on him at such a moment. If he&rsquo;s ruined, then it&rsquo;s my
hard duty to share his trouble, and I won&rsquo;t be a rat and
quit a sinking ship. That&rsquo;s not the sort of woman Ned
Dingle married.&rsquo; So Medora argued, no doubt&mdash;not
knowing, of course, what you&rsquo;ve said to Kellock. So she
went to him, and they&rsquo;ve gone to Totnes this evening along
with Ernest Trood to see a doctor. Thus you see, for
her proper and womanly behaviour, Medora will be rewarded&mdash;as
we sometimes are if we do rightly&mdash;sooner
or later.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How rewarded?&rdquo; asked Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, by hearing presently from the man that you&rsquo;re
not going to divorce her. She plays her part to him and
cheers him up and takes a hopeful view of the disaster, and
so on; and then she hears what brought it all about&mdash;your
strong line. Of course, to her ear&mdash;she being now a contrite
creature with the scales fallen from her eyes&mdash;the
fact that you wouldn&rsquo;t set her free to marry him was the
best music she could hear. She&rsquo;ll know with you taking
that line, she&rsquo;ll be free of Kellock for evermore, and able
to set about her own salvation in fear and trembling. And
that, no doubt, is what she&rsquo;ll do, for having paid for girlish
faults, she&rsquo;ll now cultivate her womanly virtues and become
as fine a creature in mind as she is in body, and rise to be
worthy of our admiration again.&rdquo;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>Ned listened to this long speech while he sowed carrots.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These things don&rsquo;t happen by chance,&rdquo; concluded
Knox. &ldquo;A man like you bends fate to his own purpose;
and fate, being a female, does a lot more for them that
drive her than them that spoil her. You stand in a very
strong position now, and the lucky thing is that the strong
can be merciful to the weak without losing their self-respect.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see Kellock,&rdquo; promised Ned. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see him to-morrow
and hear what he&rsquo;s got to say about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A very good thought, but let your mind dwell on Medora
a bit before you do. You think so clear and see so
straight that you won&rsquo;t make any mistake in that quarter.
You&rsquo;ve got to remember how it looks to Kellock so far, and
whether it looks right to him, or whether it do not. Now
Kellock only knows as yet that you don&rsquo;t put away Medora;
and that means he can&rsquo;t marry her, so this brother
and sister racket must end. As for Mrs. Dingle, she&rsquo;s
done with the masculine gender, and, of course, she may
have told Kellock so&mdash;I can&rsquo;t say as to that. But you
see him by all means.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They talked till dusk fell, then Mr. Knox departed and
Ned considered all he had said, with the imputations proper
to Philander&rsquo;s words. He had trusted largely to the vatman
of late, and found himself in agreement with his sentiments
on all occasions, for Knox was treating Ned with
rare diplomacy.</p>

<p>Next morning, Jordan himself anticipated his visitor,
and as Ned set out to see him, he appeared at Ashprington.
He wore holiday attire, looked pale, and was somewhat
nervous.</p>

<p>They met at the gate of Dingle&rsquo;s house, and Ned spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come in the house, and you can speak first&mdash;no, I
will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They entered the little parlour and sat down opposite
each other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hear you&rsquo;ve lost your stroke. I suppose to find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
what I meant to do was a bit too shattering. No doubt
you&rsquo;ll get it back. I&rsquo;ve no wish to come between you and
your livelihood; but when you and my wife hatched this
bit of wickedness, you didn&rsquo;t stop to think whether it
would play hell with my nerves; and if you&rsquo;d known it
would, that wouldn&rsquo;t have changed you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s quite true,&rdquo; admitted Kellock, &ldquo;and, I may
tell you, it&rsquo;s come home to me pretty sharp before you
said it. As for me, I may get my stroke again, or I may
not; and if I don&rsquo;t, I shall never blame you&mdash;I shall blame
myself. Those that think they stand, often get a fall, and
I&rsquo;m not too proud to confess to you that that&rsquo;s what has
happened to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Serve you right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t matter any more. What matters is Medora,
and I shall be greatly obliged if you&rsquo;ll allow me to speak a
few words on that subject.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The fewer the better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I come from myself, understand. She knows nothing
about it. I didn&rsquo;t ask her, because if she&rsquo;d said &lsquo;no,&rsquo; I
couldn&rsquo;t have come. And she might have forbid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, get on with it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very difficult, and I beg you&rsquo;ll make allowances for
a man who has done wrong and done you wrong, too.
You&rsquo;ll probably say that I&rsquo;m only changed since you told
me you weren&rsquo;t going to divorce Medora. That&rsquo;s true in
a way, but not all true. I&rsquo;ve learned a great deal I didn&rsquo;t
know from Medora, but I&rsquo;ve only come now to talk about
her. The question is how you feel about her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my business, not yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that, because as you feel, so I must do.
I recognise my obligations sharp enough, and she is the
first of them if you ordain she is to be. I&rsquo;ve thought a lot
about it you may be sure, and I&rsquo;ve recognised one thing
fairly clearly&mdash;I did before you struck this blow. I&rsquo;m
not a marrying man, Mr. Dingle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nobody ever thought you were but that fool.&rdquo;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t her fault. We were both wrong&mdash;that&rsquo;s
all. And I want to say this. I wouldn&rsquo;t marry Medora
now if I could, because I&rsquo;ve been brought to see I shouldn&rsquo;t
make her happy. A brother I&rsquo;m prepared to be; but for
her own sake, and for her future, I wouldn&rsquo;t marry her if
I could now, because I should be doing her a wrong. Of
course, you&rsquo;ll say I&rsquo;m putting this on because you won&rsquo;t
let me marry her; but I swear to you that I&rsquo;d begun to
feel it before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That lets you out then&mdash;with your tail between your
legs. And what price her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve called this morning. I can&rsquo;t say anything
to Medora until I&rsquo;ve spoken to you, because it&rsquo;s clear
that what I must do depends upon you. If you&rsquo;ve done
with her, then I shall support her and be as good a brother
as I know how to be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you ever seen the man who would take a woman
back after these games? Would you, if you was me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d think a lot before I refused, if I was you. Knox
tells me that it&rsquo;s a very uncommon case, but quite in keeping
with my character. You understand, I&rsquo;ve said nothing
to Medora. Of course, she knows what the price is
she&rsquo;s got to pay. The appearance of evil is as bad in this
case as evil itself; so she&rsquo;s doomed if you doom her, but
saved if you save her. Would it be asking too much to
ask you to see her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have seen her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not since she knew the situation. We often learn a
lesson when it&rsquo;s too late to profit by the knowledge, and it&rsquo;s
for you to judge if that will be the case with Medora. I&rsquo;m
only raising the question, and I don&rsquo;t want to fill her head
with false hopes. She&rsquo;s been too much of a lady to say
anything out; but she&rsquo;s shown her feelings on the subject
in a good many ways.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s fed up with you, in fact?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; I believe that is so. In a way, to use a homely
sort of illustration, what we did was to keep company&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>no
more than that; and that showed her very clear I&rsquo;m not
the right company; and it&rsquo;s shown me, as I say, I&rsquo;m not a
marrying man. So there it is. I can promise you your
wife will want for nothing, and I shall regard her destiny
as in my hands in future, if you&rsquo;re off her for good. And
if you change your mind and divorce her, I&rsquo;ll swear it won&rsquo;t
be me that marries her. That you can take on oath.
I&rsquo;ll tell her so to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kellock rose to go, and Ned remained silent and seated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Remember, if you do see her, you&rsquo;ll see a wiser and
sadder woman,&rdquo; the vatman ventured to add.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No doubt. You&rsquo;d make anybody sadder and wiser.
When are you going to try for your stroke again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nobody will pity you when they hear how you lost it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find Mrs. Dingle along with her people at
Priory Farm if you want her. She means to come to my
lecture next week; but not if you&rsquo;ve any objection, of
course. And I beg you to understand that I&rsquo;m heartily
sorry for what I&rsquo;ve done, and I&rsquo;m punished a lot worse
than you could punish me. To lose my stroke is nought;
to lose my self-respect is everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get &rsquo;em both back&mdash;such an amazing creature
as you,&rdquo; said Dingle dourly.</p>

<p>Then Kellock went away, and the man who had listened
to him little guessed at his soreness of spirit. Jordan indeed
had the satisfaction of clearing his soul and confessing
his weakness and failure; but he suffered ample degradation
and discomfort under his right-doing. Nor did he
believe that his end was likely to be gained. Doubting, he
had taken his proposal to Ashprington; still doubting, he
returned. Indeed, he felt sure from Ned&rsquo;s attitude, both
to him and Medora, that the girl would remain on his
hands. A subtler man had felt every reason to hope from
Dingle&rsquo;s blunt comments, but he read nothing behind them.
He only believed that he had eaten dirt for nought; yet he
did not regret his confession of wrong; for his bent of mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
was such that he knew he must have made it sooner or
later.</p>

<p>The future looked dark and sad enough. He was confused,
downcast. Even the thought of the lecture had no
present power to cheer him. But he told himself that he
had done his duty to Medora, and suspected that, had she
heard his appeal to her husband, she might have thanked
him.</p>

<p>And elsewhere Dingle pondered the problem. Curiously
enough, only a point, which had seemed unimportant to
anybody else, held his mind. Kellock had said Medora
was changed, and such is human inconsistency, that
whereas Ned had told himself for six months he was well
rid of a bad woman, now the thought that he might receive
back into his house a reformed character annoyed him.
If he wanted anybody, it was the old Medora&mdash;not the
plague, who left him for Kellock, but the laughter-loving,
illusive help-mate he had married. He did not desire a
humbled and repentant creature, ready to lick his boots.
He was very doubtful if he really wanted anybody. Once
the mistress of any man, he would never have thought of
her again except to curse her; but she never had been that.
She had doubtless shared Jordan&rsquo;s exalted ideals. That
was to her credit, and showed she honoured her first husband
and the stock she sprang from.</p>

<small>THE BARGAIN</small></h2></div>


<p>Through bright moonlight, that made the young leaves
diaphanous and melted on the grass lands in grey mist,
men and women were walking home to Ashprington from
Totnes. Not less than five-and-twenty had gone from the
Mill to hear Jordan Kellock&rsquo;s lecture on socialism; and as
they trudged homeward they discussed it.</p>

<p>He had surprised all his listeners and many were full of
enthusiasm before the future he indicated; but some were
angry; some went in doubt. The younger men were with
him and the older could not deny that there was reason
and pitiless justice behind his demands. The women who
heard him wondered at the ease with which he had spoken
and held his audience. They were impressed with the applause
that had greeted his sentiments and judged that he
must have right on his side to have won a reception so
enthusiastic.</p>

<p>Henry Barefoot, the boilerman, walked by Ernest
Trood, while Harold Spry and Daisy Finch listened to
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s got to come,&rdquo; declared Barefoot. &ldquo;We used to
talk of these problems in the merchant marine twenty-five
years ago, and we knew then that things weren&rsquo;t right; but
our generation was dumb, because our brains weren&rsquo;t educated
to pull together. We ate our mouldy biscuits and
rancid salt pork and shivered in a gale of wind, because we
knew the ship&rsquo;s bottom was rotten; and we cussed the
owners out of their snug beds ashore to hell; but we was
driven cattle, you may say&mdash;had to go on with it&mdash;because
there was nothing else for sailor men to do. But
our children have gone to school. That&rsquo;s the difference.&rdquo;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>&ldquo;And the rich men sent &rsquo;em there, Henry,&rdquo; said Mr.
Trood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They did, because they hadn&rsquo;t any choice, Ernest. If
they&rsquo;d known what would come of it, they&rsquo;d have kept &rsquo;em
out of school and left the poor man&rsquo;s children to fill the
rich men&rsquo;s pockets, instead of giving them their birthright
of education. &rsquo;Twasn&rsquo;t squire and parson sent &rsquo;em to
school, but those who had a fairer sense of justice; and
long-headed chaps like Kellock are the result.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got a lot to learn, however. There&rsquo;s no such
things as equality and never can be. Because men ain&rsquo;t
born equal, Henry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He don&rsquo;t argue that, Mr. Trood,&rdquo; explained Spry.
&ldquo;He argues that we are handicapped out of the hunt from
the start. He says, &lsquo;let all start fair&rsquo;; he don&rsquo;t say all
can win.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he does,&rdquo; returned Trood. &ldquo;He says all should
win. He tells us that a man&rsquo;s intellect is an accident, and
that, in justice, them with big brains should give their
superfluity to the fools, so as all should share and share
alike. And that&rsquo;s not human nature. Am I, that have
worked like a slave to win my position and put all my
heart and soul into paper-making from my youth up, to go
and seek that lazy dog I sacked last week and say:
&lsquo;You&rsquo;re a damned, worthless waster, but here&rsquo;s half my
wages&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I grant he was out there,&rdquo; admitted Barefoot.
&ldquo;&lsquo;The race is to the strong,&rsquo; but socialism don&rsquo;t seem to
see that. Given a fair start for all and food and clothes
and education, then the good boy gets his chance; but even
if that was so, as things are he&rsquo;d never be allowed to compete
with the gentleman&rsquo;s son.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he would,&rdquo; answered Trood. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing
in the world, even as it&rsquo;s run now, to stop brains. There&rsquo;s
boys who were charity school boys thirty years ago that
the world listens to very respectfully to-day. But Kellock&rsquo;s
let a lot of class hatred come into his talk, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
hatred breeds hatred. Never a man wanted power more
than him, but his sort go the wrong way to work with
their bluster and threats. They don&rsquo;t help: they&rsquo;re out
for blood. We&rsquo;re a very fair country at heart and under
our constitution we&rsquo;ve grown to be the finest people on
earth. So, naturally, as a whole, the nation don&rsquo;t want
the Constitution swept away till we can get a better. The
socialists have no traditions, and don&rsquo;t agree among themselves
yet, and I for one wouldn&rsquo;t trust people that scoff
at tradition and want to be a law to themselves. They
would be a great danger, Henry, and if we got all to pieces
like that and in sight of civil wars and revolution, we
should throw ourselves open to attack from our enemies.
Then, while we were wrangling how to govern ourselves,
we&rsquo;d damn soon find England was going to be governed by
somebody else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s plenty of hungry eyes on the British Empire
no doubt,&rdquo; allowed Mr. Barefoot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Plenty; and if our army and navy got bitten with this
stuff, it would be good-bye to everything. And that
wouldn&rsquo;t suit Kellock&rsquo;s friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And be it as it will,&rdquo; said Daisy Finch, &ldquo;a paper mill
isn&rsquo;t a charity. Those that run the Mill have got to live,
I suppose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Daisy,&rdquo; admitted Trood; &ldquo;but we must be fair to
this Kellock, though I&rsquo;m far from supporting what he says.
The ills are as he stated them; the remedies are not as he
stated &rsquo;em. He argues that the workman&rsquo;s work should
no more be his whole life than work is his master&rsquo;s whole
life. Because Capital buys a man&rsquo;s working hours, it
doesn&rsquo;t buy his life and liberties. Outside his work, he&rsquo;s
as much right to enjoy being alive as his employer. A
machine looks very different from the owner&rsquo;s point of
view and the worker&rsquo;s. The owner&rsquo;s the master of the
machine; the worker is its slave; and it&rsquo;s on the worker the
machine puts the strain, not on the owner. So we have got
to consider our working hours in relation to our lives as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
whole, and balance work against life, and consider how
our labour affects our existence. A six hour day at a
machine may be a far greater tax on a man or woman
than an eight hour day at the desk, or the plough. You&rsquo;ve
got to think of the nervous energy, which ain&rsquo;t unlimited.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; admitted Barefoot. &ldquo;Life&rsquo;s the only
adventure we can hope for, and I grant you there ought
to be more to it. &rsquo;Tis all this here speeding up, I mistrust.
The masters see the result of &lsquo;speeding up,&rsquo; and
think it&rsquo;s all to the good according; but it&rsquo;s we feel the
result, and I can tell you I&rsquo;m never more cranky and bad-tempered
and foul-mouthed than after one of them rushes.
The strain is only pounds, shillings and pence to the masters;
but it&rsquo;s flesh and blood and nerves to us; because it&rsquo;s
us have got to fight the machines, not them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A very true word, Henry. Kellock&rsquo;s out for security,
and whether you&rsquo;re a socialist or whether you&rsquo;re not, you
can&rsquo;t deny security is the due of every human creature.
Until the highest and lowest alike are born into security,
there&rsquo;s something wrong with the order of things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet the greater number of the nation have no more
security than a bird in a bush. Let us but lose our health,
and where are we?&rdquo; asked Barefoot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if a machine is going to make us lose our health,&rdquo;
argued Spry, &ldquo;then to hell with the machine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We want shorter hours and better money,&rdquo; explained
Ernest Trood, &ldquo;and that can only be won if the masters
also get better money. And for such a result we must
look to machines.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Daisy Finch asked a question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who were those stern-looking men in black ties listening
to the lecture?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From Plymouth, I believe,&rdquo; answered her sweetheart.
&ldquo;They meant business, and they applauded Kellock at the
finish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They see a likely tool to help their plots,&rdquo; said Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
Trood. &ldquo;I hope he&rsquo;ll get his stroke back and drop this
Jack-o&rsquo;-lantern job. There&rsquo;s quite enough at it without
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; answered Barefoot. &ldquo;He wants
to be in the movement, and may rise to be a leader some
day. They socialists are as ambitious as anybody at
heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harold and Miss Finch, weary of the subject, slowed
their gait, fell back, and presently turned to their own
affairs. Then a trap passed, driven by Mr. Tom Dolbear,
from Priory Farm. He had brought his sister and Medora
to the lecture, and was now taking them home again.
With them travelled Mr. Knox.</p>

<p>The farmer alone found no good word for the things
they had listened to.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just the gift of the gab,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If you can talk
easy, you&rsquo;re tempted to do so, at the expense of work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Talking is working when you&rsquo;re out for a cause,&rdquo; explained
Knox. &ldquo;Kellock&rsquo;s not a talker in the way we are.
In fact, a very silent man, and thinks a great deal more
than he talks; but with practice and a bit of exercise to
strengthen his voice, he&rsquo;d be as good as any of the talking
brigade; and though you may not agree with him, you
can&rsquo;t deny he&rsquo;s got the faith to move mountains. He&rsquo;s
preaching a gospel that Labour&rsquo;s perfectly ready and willing
to hear, and he&rsquo;ll be an easy winner presently, because
it&rsquo;s half the battle won to tell people the things they&rsquo;ll
welcome. Everybody was with him from the start, and
the harder he hit, the better they liked it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think Totnes had gone so radical now-a-days,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Trivett.</p>

<p>&ldquo;More it has,&rdquo; declared Mr. Dolbear. &ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t
Totnes. &rsquo;Twas no more than a handful of discontented
people, who don&rsquo;t know what they want.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make no mistake as to that,&rdquo; answered Knox. &ldquo;The
brains of Totnes was there&mdash;the thinking ones that ain&rsquo;t
satisfied; and they do know what they want very well in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>deed;
and Kellock&rsquo;s talk only said what the others feel.
He&rsquo;s got a gift in my opinion, and I&rsquo;m with him more than
half the way. If you allow for ignorance and impatience
of youth, and so on&mdash;if you grant all that, there&rsquo;s still
enough left to make a reputation. He&rsquo;ll never be a happy
man, but he&rsquo;ll make his mark and have the satisfaction
of being somebody in the labour world. He&rsquo;s got the
touch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Medora considered curiously with herself under the
night. Her own changed attitude surprised her most.
She had heard the applause and riot that greeted Jordan&rsquo;s
speech. She had seen him stand there, self-contained and
strong and successful, before three hundred people. She
had marked his power to impress them, and awaken enthusiasm.
She had seen older men than himself lifted to excitement
by his speech. She had noted how many men
and women pressed forward to shake hands with him when
he had finished. She remembered the chairman&rsquo;s praise.
All these things had actually filled her dreams of old. She
had prophesied to him that such events would some day
happen, and that his power must become known, given the
opportunity. And now, far sooner than either had expected
such a thing, it had come and justified Medora&rsquo;s
prophecies. She wondered whether Kellock was remembering
all she had foretold. As for herself, she looked at him
now as at a picture that hung in somebody else&rsquo;s parlour.
She witnessed the sunrise of his first triumph, but found
herself perfectly indifferent and not desirous of one ray
of reflected light. Her mind had passed from Kellock to
other interests, and if she were ever to be a contented
woman, it would not be Kellock who achieved that consummation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jordan was to attend a meeting of his branch after the
lecture,&rdquo; she said to Knox. &ldquo;I expect after such a success
as that, they&rsquo;ll want him to give the lecture somewhere
else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking of the effect on his nature,&rdquo; answered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
Knox. &ldquo;And I believe all that applause will be a better
tonic than Dartmoor, and make the man well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think it will fetch his stroke back again?&rdquo; asked
Mrs. Trivett.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I do think, Lydia. He&rsquo;ll be walking
on air after such a triumph as that. He&rsquo;ll fear nothing
when he comes back to the vat, and all will go right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then, Mr. Knox, for private ends, and suspecting he
had praised Kellock enough, turned on the lecture, and
began to display its fallacies and errors. For Medora&rsquo;s
benefit he examined the young man, and declared that his
address revealed the defects of his qualities. But he need
not have been at the trouble to occupy himself thus; Medora
knew a great deal more about the real Jordan than
it was possible for Mr. Knox to know.</p>

<p>She listened, but took no more part in the conversation.
They proceeded down the steep lane into Ashprington
presently, and at Ned Dingle&rsquo;s home, Knox, to their
surprise, bade Mr. Dolbear draw up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going in here,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;So I&rsquo;ll wish you all
&lsquo;good night.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dingle, who knew the party was to pass, stood at his
outer gate smoking. Only Lydia addressed him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good night, Ned,&rdquo; she said, and he answered:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good night, mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the trap proceeded and Mr. Dolbear permitted
himself to speak rather spitefully of Philander Knox.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t sound, that man,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;He wants
to run with the hare and hunt with the hounds. You don&rsquo;t
know where to have him in argument, the truth being he
ain&rsquo;t much in earnest about anything in my opinion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Tom Dolbear modified this view before many days
were passed. Indeed, had he listened to the conversation
then proceeding between Philander and Mr. Dingle, he
must have found himself confronted sharply and painfully
with mistaken judgment; and Mr. Knox himself did not
guess at the important events destined to fall out before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
he slept that night. That certain things were presently
to happen; that he would pluck his own occasions out of
them and win a reward worthy of all his pains, he believed;
but he did not know how near these things might be. Nor
did he imagine how swiftly his own particular problems
were destined to be solved. Now Medora&rsquo;s husband played
into his hand with unexpected perception.</p>

<p>They spoke first concerning the lecture, and Ned heard
without enthusiasm of its success.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No doubt the only thing that concerns you is why
your wife went,&rdquo; said Knox, &ldquo;and I may tell you she went
because she&rsquo;d promised to go. It bored her stiff, same as
it did Mrs. Trivett. They&rsquo;ve got no use for the new
paths, and Medora&rsquo;s just as much of a Tory at heart as
you or her mother, though she wouldn&rsquo;t own to it. That&rsquo;s
all over, any way. They&rsquo;ve parted in a dignified fashion,
and I&rsquo;ve done the best day&rsquo;s work I ever have done in helping
you to see the peculiar circumstances and putting the
truth before you. Not that even my great efforts would
have saved the situation if you hadn&rsquo;t believed me; but that
was your stronghold: you knew I was telling truth. In
fact, it&rsquo;s one of those cases where knowledge of the truth
has helped the parties through the storm, and I&rsquo;ll be
thankful to my dying day you was large-minded enough to
receive and accept it. It was a great compliment to me
that you could trust me, and a great advertisement to your
brain power.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all your work and I don&rsquo;t deny you the praise,&rdquo;
answered Ned. &ldquo;Of course, if things had been otherwise
from what they are, nothing would have come of it; but as
the facts are what we understand, then I&rsquo;m half in a mind
to take Medora back. I dare say the people will think
I&rsquo;m a silly, knock-kneed fool to do so; but those who know
the truth would not. There&rsquo;s only one thing will prevent
me, and that&rsquo;s the woman herself. I&rsquo;ll see her presently,
and if she comes out of it in a decent spirit, then what I
say may happen. But if there&rsquo;s a shadow of doubt about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
it in her mind, then we&rsquo;ll stop as we are. It pretty much
depends upon her now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In that case I congratulate you, because her spirit is
contrite to the dust, and never, if she lives to be a hundred,
will she fail of her duty again. She&rsquo;ll be a pattern to
every married woman on earth for the rest of her life, no
doubt. The highest and best she prays for is to be forgiven
by you; but she don&rsquo;t dare to hope even that; and if
she found she was more than forgiven, then her gratitude
would rise to amazing heights, no doubt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well it might,&rdquo; declared Dingle, and the other spoke
again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; and none better pleased than me; but though I
hadn&rsquo;t thought we&rsquo;d got nearly so far as this yet awhile,
now I see that we have, I must speak a word more, Ned.
What I&rsquo;m going to say now is a terrible delicate thing;
and yet, late though the hour is, this is the appointed time.
Give me a spot of whiskey and switch off from yourself to
me for five minutes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was coming to you. I&rsquo;m not blind, and I see very
clearly what I owe you in this matter. You&rsquo;ve took a
deal of trouble, and I&rsquo;m grateful, Knox, and so will everybody
else be when they understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very glad you feel it so,&rdquo; answered Philander,
&ldquo;because it&rsquo;s true. I have took a lot of trouble, Ned,
and I&rsquo;ve spared no pains to bring this about, because well
I knew from my experience of life that it was the best that
could possibly happen for all concerned. And once convinced
them two were innocent as babes, I set myself to
save the situation, as they say. And I&rsquo;ve helped you to
do so; and it ain&rsquo;t a figure of speech to say I&rsquo;m well paid
by results. But that&rsquo;s not all there is to it. There was
something up my sleeve too. I had another iron in the
fire for myself. In a word, you can pay me handsome
for all my trouble if you&rsquo;ll recognise that and lend me a
hand in a certain quarter. Need I say what quarter?
As you know, Mrs. Trivett&rsquo;s very much addicted to me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
and she&rsquo;d marry me to-morrow if a mistaken call of duty
didn&rsquo;t keep her in that breeding pen known as Priory
Farm. Well, I put it to you whether you won&rsquo;t help
me same as I helped you. One good turn deserves another&mdash;eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d go to the end of the world to help you, Knox.
But what can I do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t see? I&rsquo;ll tell you then. It sounds a bit
strong, but it&rsquo;s safe enough and it&rsquo;ll do the trick. Above
all you needn&rsquo;t feel a speck of fear, because your mother-in-law
has a very fine affection for me, and to marry me
will really be a great delight to her&mdash;that I assure you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What must I do then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Merely tell Medora you don&rsquo;t look at her again unless
Mrs. Trivett changes her name to Mrs. Knox. I&rsquo;m not
asking a difficult or troublesome thing. In fact, you
needn&rsquo;t lift a finger in the matter. You can safely leave
it to Medora. She&rsquo;ll praise God on her knees for a month
of Sundays when she hears the grand ideas in your mind,
and when you state the condition&mdash;there you are: she&rsquo;ll
be on to her mother like a flame of fire, and Lydia will
mighty soon see her duty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ned Dingle laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lord, you&rsquo;re a deep one!&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not me. Far from it. Just ordinary common sense,
and a great natural regard for Medora&rsquo;s mother. Mind,
I wouldn&rsquo;t ask if it wasn&rsquo;t a dead cert.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It shall be done,&rdquo; answered the younger man.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a double chap, Knox, though you do claim to be
so simple, and I&rsquo;d rather have you for a friend than an
enemy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be your friend as long as I live, I promise you&mdash;and
your wife also. A very good father-in-law you&rsquo;ll
find me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They went to the door together and as Knox was about
to depart, there came a swift foot down the lane. It was
Jordan Kellock on his homeward way.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>He stopped, seeing the men at the gate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was going to call first thing to-morrow, Mr. Dingle,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;but since you&rsquo;re here I can speak now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And give me an arm afterwards,&rdquo; declared Knox.
For the moon had set and it was very dark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only this: the leaders liked what I said to-night, and
they liked how I said it. In a word they have offered me
propaganda work. I&rsquo;m to travel about and have my headquarters
in London. My life&rsquo;s begun in fact. I tell you
this, because now you&rsquo;re free to go back to the Mill, for I
shall not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Giving up paper-making?&rdquo; asked Philander.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Knox. I shall never touch a mould again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll never know if you&rsquo;ve lost your stroke, or
get it back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All&rsquo;s one now. There&rsquo;s only Mrs. Dingle to consider.
Have you been able to make up your mind in that matter
yet, Mr. Dingle?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have,&rdquo; said Ned; &ldquo;but she don&rsquo;t know it and I&rsquo;ll
thank you not to tell her. That&rsquo;s my job.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank God,&rdquo; said Kellock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Knox,&rdquo; added Ned. &ldquo;But for him there&rsquo;s no
shadow of doubt things would have happened differently.
But as luck would have it you confided in him, and so
did I; and being what he is, he puts his intellects into the
thing and saved us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t forget it,&rdquo; said Kellock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And we shan&rsquo;t forget you,&rdquo; declared Knox. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
all three mighty well out of this, and though you&rsquo;ve been
an amazing ass, yet there was a fine quality in your foolishness
that saved the situation. You&rsquo;ve all got peace
with honour in fact; and may you profit by your lesson
and your luck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Knox and Kellock set off down the hill together.</p>

<small>FIRE BEACON HILL</small></h2></div>


<p>Free horizons stretched about the grassy summit of Fire
Beacon, a culminating ridge above Dart.</p>

<p>It ascended from a glorious ambit of hill and valley,
moor and sea; and on this silvery noon of early summer,
light rained out of the zenith and echoed in the scattered
cloud argosies that sailed from the north to seaward. Under
them spread a mosaic of multicoloured fields netted
with hedges and knotted with copses or spinneys, grey
hamlets and little thorpes. The million breasts of Artemis
Devonia undulated beneath the shining patchwork
and faded into distance over many leagues of sunkissed
weald and wold, until they rippled dimly to the foothills
and forest edges of Dartmoor, where the high lands were
flung hugely out from east to west. To-day the Moor
shone full of delicate colour under the sun. It rose and
fell in a lustrous opaline sky line of gentle salients; it
melted at the magic of the universal light and seemed no
more than a delicate veil of grey and azure imposed transparently
upon the brighter blue above it. From Hey
Tor to Rippon it rolled, to Buckland and Holne Moor,
with shadowy glimpses of Hameldon and remote Cosdon;
to Dean Moor and Harford, by Eastern Beacon and
Western Beacon, Lee Moor and Shell Top and far border
heights that brooded through the milky hazes of the west.</p>

<p>Beneath Fire Beacon lay the clustered dwellings of East
Cornworthy, and beyond them, deep in the heart of the
land, shone Dart where there bent away Bow Creek above
Stoke Gabriel. The river wound argent through a dimple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
of the bending hills, while easterly, by broad passages of
woodland and fallow, opened the ways to the sea. Tor
Bay stretched there with white Torquay glittering pearly
under her triple hills; and far beyond them, touched
through the haze by a falling sunshaft, glimmered the
headlands eastward, cliff beyond cliff, where the red sandstone
of Devon gave to the golden oolites of Dorset. Then
ranged the sea-line and rolled wide waters soaked with
light, whereon the clouds not only flung down their shadows,
but poured their reflections also, so that the sea was
radiant as the land.</p>

<p>Fire Beacon bore hay, and as the wind rippled the distant
waters, so here, through ripening grass, over sparkling
white daisies and russet sorrel, it ran and swept
and sent a lustre, that danced upon the hill and stroked
the herbage with fitful waves of light. A cuckoo called
from an elm top and overhead wheeled the gulls to link
earth and sea together.</p>

<p>Hither climbed a party of four holiday makers, of whom
two were middle-aged and two were young. The more
youthful pair walked some hundred yards ahead and bore
between them a hamper; their elders breasted the great hill
more leisurely and stopped sometimes upon the way.
Once, where a grassy dip in the hedge bank invited them
to do so, they sat down to rest for a while.</p>

<p>Ned and Medora reached the crown of Fire Beacon and
sought a place for their picnic under the nearest hedge.
They found it presently, but waited until Lydia and
Philander should arrive and approve.</p>

<p>Perfect understanding appeared to obtain between the
husband and wife. Medora was attired in a pre-Kellock
gown, which Mr. Dingle had always admired. Indeed she
had given the garments that came from London to Daisy
Finch. She had been highly ingenious in returning to the
old rgime at every minute particular, and in banishing to
the void any evidence of the inter-regnum. She came back
to Ned sufficiently contrite and sufficiently grateful and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
thankful. Her tact had been sharpened by tribulation,
and remembering very well what was good to her husband,
she wasted not much time on tears of repentance or promises
of future well doing. She let her luck take the form
of joyousness&mdash;which suited Dingle best. Her gratitude
assumed the most agreeable shape from his point of
view, for she exhibited such delight in her home and such
radiant happiness in his company that he found himself
content. Nor, for once, was there any simulation on
Medora&rsquo;s part. She felt the satisfaction she expressed.
She appreciated the extent of her remarkable good fortune
and desired nothing more than a return to the life
she had under-valued. They were for the moment not
talking of themselves, but Medora&rsquo;s mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor dear! You may say that Aunt Mary and Uncle
Tom pretty well cast her out,&rdquo; said Mrs. Dingle. &ldquo;A
proper shame I call it, and a proper lesson not to work
your fingers to the bone for other people&rsquo;s children.
You&rsquo;d think mother was a traitor to &rsquo;em, instead of the
best friend they ever had, or will have&mdash;selfish creatures.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ve done her a very good turn by getting her
out of that house. Knox will know how to value such a
fine woman, though it&rsquo;s contrary to nature that two old
blades like them should feel all younger people feel, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He feels enough not to let mother work in the Mill
any more,&rdquo; said Medora.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you know you need not, if you don&rsquo;t want.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do, you dear. But I&rsquo;m only too jolly thankful to
be back there and that&rsquo;s the truth. I&rsquo;d sooner be there
than anywhere, because I&rsquo;m nearer to you all day, and we
can eat our dinner together. But mother&rsquo;s different and
Mr. Knox has very dignified ideas how she should live at
her age.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You say &lsquo;at her age,&rsquo; but be blessed if this racket
hasn&rsquo;t knocked years off her,&rdquo; said Ned. &ldquo;I can quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
imagine a man of half a century old might think her good-looking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By a curious coincidence Philander was stating the same
opinion half a mile down the hill. Indeed Lydia&rsquo;s face
seemed a palimpsest to Mr. Knox, and through more recent
writings, to her countenance there would still come
a twinkle from the past and a flash and flush, that penetrated
thirty years of Time&rsquo;s caligraphy and seemed to
recreate her features, even to a little curl at the corner
of her under-lip, that belonged to youth and had been
delicious then.</p>

<p>Mr. Knox perceived these things.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dammy, you&rsquo;re growing younger under my very eyes,
Lydia,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>She laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tom didn&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;He said that
for an aged woman&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get him out of your mind,&rdquo; said Mr. Knox. &ldquo;The
forties are often very unmerciful to the fifties&mdash;a trick
of human nature I can&rsquo;t explain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know I&rsquo;m younger; and it&rsquo;s largely along of you,
Philander, but not all. You can understand how the
thought of them two up there have made me younger. I
never dreamed they could come together again&mdash;not in
my most hopeful moments.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because you didn&rsquo;t know how short a distance
they&rsquo;d really fallen apart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis too good to be true. I&rsquo;m frightened of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You never was frightened of
anything and never will be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For that matter there is a dark side,&rdquo; explained
Lydia, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m almost glad there is in a way, because
if there wasn&rsquo;t, the whole story would be contrary to nature
and would tumble down like a pack of cards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no dark side, and I won&rsquo;t have you say there
is, Lyddy. Why shouldn&rsquo;t the Lord hatch a piece of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
happiness for four humans once in a way, if He&rsquo;s got a
mind to do it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t the Almighty; it&rsquo;s my people at Priory Farm.
I heard some bitter things there I do assure you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet you did,&rdquo; said Mr. Knox. &ldquo;I can see &rsquo;em at
you. And I can also very well guess what they said about
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Especially Mary. I never heard her use such language,
and I never saw her so properly awake before.
But I was glad after, because when she called you a crafty
old limb of the Dowl, that got my fighting spirit up and
they heard a home truth or two. I thought they were
very different stuff.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you take people as you find &rsquo;em, you&rsquo;ll make
friends,&rdquo; answered Mr. Knox; &ldquo;but if you take people as
you fancy &rsquo;em, you will not. No doubt folk are very flattered
at first to find our opinion of &rsquo;em is as high as their
opinion of themselves. But that don&rsquo;t last. We can&rsquo;t
for long think of any fellow creature as highly as he thinks
of himself. The strain&rsquo;s too great, and so, presently,
we come down to the truth about our friend; and he sees
we know it and can&rsquo;t forgive us. So the friendship fades
out, because it was built on fancy and not on reality.
That&rsquo;s what happens to most friendships in the long run.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose I never got quite a true picture of my brother&rsquo;s
wife,&rdquo; admitted Lydia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did not. And what&rsquo;s hurting her so sharp for the
minute and making her so beastly rude is&mdash;not so much
your going, as your knowing the truth about her. But
don&rsquo;t you fret. They&rsquo;ll cringe presently. I dare say
they&rsquo;ll be at our wedding yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I could think so,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;But it
ought to come right, for, after all, I&rsquo;m a mother too, and
what choice had I when Ned got me in a corner like that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not an earthly,&rdquo; declared Mr. Knox.</p>

<p>They joined Ned and Medora presently. The view was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
nothing to any of them, but the elders welcomed the breeze
at hill top. Their talk concerned the wedding.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A very Christian spirit in the air,&rdquo; Philander asserted.
&ldquo;Even Nicholas Pinhey has forgiven me, thanks to your
mother, Medora. He dropped in on Saturday, and he
said, &lsquo;You called me a caterpillar, not so very many weeks
ago, Mr. Knox,&rsquo; and I answered, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;re right.&rsquo;
And he said, &lsquo;Yes; and when you done so, I thought it
was a case of &ldquo;Father, forgive him, for he knows not what
he sayeth.&rdquo; And I wish you to understand that I forgive
it and forget it also, out of respect for Mrs. Trivett.
The man that Mrs. Trivett thinks good enough to marry
must have some virtues hidden from common eyes,&rsquo; said
Nicholas to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Mercy Life&rsquo;s forgiven me,&rdquo; said Medora. &ldquo;I
wouldn&rsquo;t let her have any peace till she did. And Alice
Barefoot passes the time of day even! That&rsquo;s thanks to
mother of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re getting up a fine wedding present for mother
in the rag house,&rdquo; announced Ned. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a secret, but
Henry Barefoot told me. It&rsquo;s going to take the shape of
a tea service, I believe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see myself away from the rag house,&rdquo; murmured
Mrs. Trivett.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t see yourself away from Priory Farm,
mother,&rdquo; said Medora.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a want of imagination in you, Lydia,&rdquo; declared
Mr. Knox. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll say you can&rsquo;t see yourself married
to me next. But that you certainly will see inside a month
from Sunday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They spoke of various matters that interested them;
then Mr. Knox mentioned Kellock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Strange that a man born and bred under the apple
trees of Ashprington should show these gifts. A great
paper maker; and as if that was not enough, a power of
talk and a talent for politics. Not that he&rsquo;ll ever be half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
as good in his new line as he was in his old. A man can&rsquo;t
rise to be first class at two crafts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Labour Party will swallow him up, and we shan&rsquo;t
hear no more about him, I expect,&rdquo; said Lydia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it. He hadn&rsquo;t the very highest gifts to deal
with his fellow men&mdash;not the touch of genius&mdash;too
deadly serious and narrow. You feel about that sort a
very proper respect; but you&rsquo;d a long sight sooner live
with their statues than themselves. &rsquo;Tis always uncomfortable
living with heroes&mdash;even little tin ones&mdash;but
when time has took &rsquo;em and just kneaded what good they&rsquo;ve
done into the common wealth of human progress&mdash;then
we can feel kindly to their memories.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ope the hamper, Ned,&rdquo; said Lydia.</p>

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
